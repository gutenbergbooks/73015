<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I</h2>

<p class='no-indent'><span class='smcap'>At</span>
the hour between sunset and twilight Miss
Page was generally to be found in her garden.</p>

<p>The long irregular front of Fairholme
Court faced the west, and before it, through
the interminable evenings of summer, was
spread the pageant of the sunset, the quiet
glory of the after-glow, and finally the transition,
mysterious, indefinably subtle, from the
light of day, to the vaporous purple of night.</p>

<p>It was at this quiet end of evening that
the garden, always beautiful, took on an added
grace, the dream-like delicate charm which
belongs to the enchanted places of the earth—places
such as Corot knew, and with a
magic equal to their own, has transferred upon
canvasses which hold for ever the glamour of
the dawn or the mystic spell of twilight.</p>

<p>The house, built originally in the last
years of Elizabeth, and enlarged in succeeding

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
reigns, was a medley of incongruous architecture,
resulting in a style delightful and
fantastic enough for a dwelling in a fairy tale.
The latest wing, added in Georgian days, its
red brick toned now to a restful mellow colour,
imparted an air of formal stateliness to the
irregular but charming structure.</p>

<p>Roses wreathed the latticed window-panes
of the older part of the house; clematis rioted
over part of the roof and climbed the chimney-stacks.
On the sunny walls of the later wing
a vine had been trained.</p>

<p>The door of the panelled hall in the middle
of the house opened upon a square of flagstones,
and level with these, a lawn, its
smoothness unspoilt by flower-beds, stretched
to a sunk fence from which meadowland,
whose broad expanse was broken here and
there by groups of elms, extended far as the
eye could see till its verge touched the sunset
sky.</p>

<p>On the lawn to the right of the house, one
magnificent beech tree swept the ground with
its lower branches, and then soared majestically
towards the sky. On the left there
was a group of chestnuts. But, except for
a small white fountain opposite the hall porch,
the lawn in its velvet softness was left
unadorned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span></p>

<p>The fountain Miss Page had brought back
after one of her periodical journeys to Italy.
It was a slight, graceful thing, of delicate
workmanship, its thread of water falling from
a fluted shell into a square marble basin. It
was a fountain beloved by the fan-tailed pigeons,
who from their dovecote behind the kitchen
garden came to it often to drink. When they
perched on the edge of the shell, or walked
near it on the grass, their snowy tails outspread,
a hint of Italian courtyards, a sort of
fragrance of Italy, was wafted into the English
garden.</p>

<p>All the flowers grew in secluded sheltered
spots, protected by high walls or hedges of
yew.</p>

<p>Away from the lawn, behind the beech
tree, a moss-grown wall into which a little
gate was set, gave promise of scent and colour
within—of a garden enclosed.</p>

<p>This particular enclosure, one of many,
was known as the “lavender garden.” It was
arranged in the formal Dutch fashion—divided
into square beds filled with pink monthly
roses, each bed surrounded by a thick border
of lavender. A sundial stood in the midst,
and against the sundial, her elbows resting
upon its lichen-stained plate, leant Anne Page,
her face turned towards the lingering sunset.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span></p>

<p>She was expecting friends to dinner, but
unable to resist the temptation of the garden,
she had wandered from the drawing-room into
the sweet evening air. She wore a dress the
colour of which, in its shades of grey-green
and purple, might have been suggested by the
lavender in the borders. It was a graceful
flowing dress; beautiful naturally, inevitably.
Anne Page possessed the gift of surrounding
herself with everything that was exquisite, as
simply as a flower surrounds itself with leaves
and dainty buds.</p>

<p>She was not a young woman. She had
indeed travelled quite far on the road that
leads from youth to death.</p>

<p>It was even on record that a girl staying
at the vicarage had alluded to her as an old
lady.</p>

<p>Every one had started with shocked surprise.
None of Anne Page’s friends were
accustomed to consider her age.</p>

<p>To them, she was just “beautiful Miss
Page.” In the same way, one never thought
of analyzing her appearance, nor of criticizing
her features. It would have seemed an impertinence.
One felt vaguely that she would
have been quite as lovely without any, for her
beauty was like a rare effect of light that has
no connection with the object it transfigures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span></p>

<p>Certainly her face had the delicacy of a
white rose. Certainly her eyes were blue; blue
as cornflowers; blue as the sea. But they
were Miss Page’s eyes, and one instinctively
compared them to lovely natural things.</p>

<p>She turned her head as the gate creaked.</p>

<p>Burks, in a frilled apron and a becoming
cap with streamers, was hurrying up the path
towards the sundial.</p>

<p>“There’s a carriage coming up the drive,
ma’am,” she said.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Burks, I’ll come.”</p>

<p>The maid hastened back, her skirts ruffling
the lavender borders, and, gathering up the
filmy folds of her own gown, her mistress
followed her.</p>

<p>At the gate, she turned for a last glance at
the dying sunset sky.</p>

<p>On her way across the lawn, she noticed,
with a thrill of pleasure, the beauty of the
trees, motionless, dreaming in the dusk. White
and slim in the half-light, the little fountain
suggested to her a strayed nymph, transfixed
with surprise and fear to find herself so near
the haunts of man. Smiling at the fancy,
Anne entered the drawing-room by one of the
long open windows, and waited for her guests.</p>

<p>In a few moments, Burks admitted the
Vicar and his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span></p>

<p>The Reverend George Carfax was of
the type already somewhat <i lang='fr'>vieux jeu</i>, of the
muscular school of Christianity.</p>

<p>Good-looking, clean-shaven, bullet-headed,
his appearance was rather that of a country
squire than of a vicar of Christ. An excellent
cricketer, hearty in manner, sound in health,
he was nevertheless the ideal pastor for the
rising generation of youths and maidens, whose
muscles were possibly better worth developing
than their souls.</p>

<p>His wife was the dowdy little woman, who
inevitably by a process of natural selection
becomes the mate of the muscular Christian.</p>

<p>In her first youth she had possessed the undistinguished
prettiness common to thousands
of English girls whose character, composed of
negative qualities, renders them peculiarly acceptable
to the average self-assertive man.</p>

<p>Now, at forty-five, in spite of her family of
children, her figure was as spare and meagre as
it had been at twenty, and the gown she wore,
a black silk, slightly cut out at the neck, and
trimmed with cheap coffee lace, was as dowdy
as any of the dresses of her girlhood.</p>

<p>Miss Page walked with a charming dignity,
her long gown moving over the floor with a
soft <i lang='fr'>frou-frou</i> suggestive of silk, and cloudy
concealed frills. Her appearance as she bent

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
towards the dowdy little woman, made a contrast
almost ludicrous, if it had not also been
somewhat pathetic.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carfax, innocent of contrasts and all
they implied, took her hand in both of hers
with an affectionate movement, and in the
Vicar’s firm handshake, and in his hearty words
of greeting, the same evident liking for their
hostess was expressed.</p>

<p>“Dr. and Mrs. Dakin,” said Burks, at the
door, and again Miss Page’s smile welcomed
the new-comers.</p>

<p>She particularly liked the tall thin man
who entered. Dr. Dakin was a scholar and a
dreamer, a man too unpractical by nature
adequately to cope with a profession eminently
practical. The doctor was only a partial
success at Dymfield, where a man of the
Vicar’s stamp, genial, a trifle blustering, always
cheerful, would have inspired more confidence
than the dreamy medical man, who did not
treat illness in the high-handed fashion unconsciously
expected by his patients.</p>

<p>Only his success with one or two really
serious cases in the neighbourhood preserved
for him some measure of respect, and a general
concurrence of opinion, that absent-minded as
he appeared before the milder forms of ailment,
when it came to graver maladies, Dr. Dakin

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
was presumably to be trusted. To no one
was his lack of force and “push” a greater
trial than to his wife, whose ambition for her
husband had been a London practice, and for
herself a smart amusing circle of acquaintances.</p>

<p>She was a pretty little woman of six or
seven and twenty, with soft dark hair, and
a slim figure. Endowed with all the nervous
energy her husband lacked, she bore the traces
of her discontent about her well-shaped mouth,
and in the expression, exasperated and querulous
of her brown eyes.</p>

<p>They softened into a wholly admiring
glance however as they rested on Miss
Page.</p>

<p>“My dear lady,” she whispered, “that’s the
most lovely dress I ever saw in my life!
Where <em>do</em> you get your things? And however
do you manage to look so delightful in
them?”</p>

<p>Anne laughed.</p>

<p>“Let me return the compliment. You look
charming, Madge.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dakin blushed with pleasure, as she
turned to shake hands with Mrs. Carfax.</p>

<p>“We are waiting for another guest,” said
Miss Page, sitting down in one of the big,
chintz-covered chairs. “Monsieur Fontenelle,
who, as I dare say you know, has just been

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
made President of the International Art
Congress.”</p>

<p>Dr. Dakin looked up quickly from the
examination of an eighteenth-century fan,
which he recognized as a new treasure in a
cabinet filled with ivories, enamel snuff-boxes,
old lace, old treasures of all kinds.</p>

<p>“Really?” he exclaimed. “That’s most
interesting. <em>The</em> Monsieur Fontenelle, in
fact?”</p>

<p>“He’s a very old friend of mine,” said
Anne.</p>

<p>“In England for the opening of the show
next week, of course?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He’s been staying for a couple of
days at The Chase, and as he goes to London
to-morrow I asked him to join us this evening.”</p>

<p>To none of Anne’s visitors but the doctor
was the Frenchman’s name significant.</p>

<p>Dymfield was not interested in the world
of art. Very few of its inhabitants had ever
heard of the International Art Congress, and
even if they had, it would have conveyed
nothing to their minds.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a tremor of excitement and
curiosity passed over the faces of Mrs. Carfax
and Mrs. Dakin.</p>

<p>Strangers at Dymfield were rare, and a
visitor who was staying at The Chase, as the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
guest of Lord Farringchurch was on that
account alone, a distinguished if not an alarming
personality.</p>

<p>“A Frenchman!” exclaimed Mrs. Carfax.
“I hope he speaks English?” she added below
her breath.</p>

<p>“Oh, perfectly,” Anne assured her, as the
door opened.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Fontenelle!”</p>

<p>Burks, who had frequently accompanied her
mistress in foreign travel, delivered the name
with commendable swing and correctness of
accent.</p>

<p>The man who entered looked considerably
younger than his forty-seven years. Slight,
still elegant in figure, his face possessed the distinction
of clear-cut features, combined with an
expression which only the charm of his smile
saved from a suspicion of arrogance.</p>

<p>His hair, a little white on the temples, was
thick and slightly wavy. His blue eyes, keen
above a hawk-like nose, gleamed every now
and then with a trace of irony; that irony
which has become habitual, the recognized
medium through which its possessor views the
world. A shrewd observer would have guessed
the character represented by such a face to be
difficult and complex. Instinctively one knew
that François Fontenelle would be no very

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
easy man to thwart; one guessed also that he
might be a man apt to form his own rules
of conduct, to carve his own path in life,
without too much consideration for the convenience
or the paths of others.</p>

<p>As Miss Page rose and stretched out her
hand, he stooped and kissed it with the graceful
ease of manner natural to a Frenchman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carfax felt quite embarrassed.</p>

<p>“So foreign,” she thought; the phrase
expressing unconscious disapprobation.</p>

<p>“Glad <em>we</em> haven’t those monkey tricks!”
was her husband’s half-formed mental exclamation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dakin’s heart gave a curious little
flutter for which she could not account, except
that she liked the manners of Frenchmen, and
was for the moment acutely conscious of the
dulness of life.</p>

<p>To her husband, the action suddenly recalled
the days of Madame de Pompadour.</p>

<p>He glanced at the fan he still held, and his
mind wandered to a book of that lady’s period
which he had long coveted, and had hitherto
been unable to obtain.</p>

<p>Absorbed in reverie, he missed Miss Page’s
formal introduction, and was only recalled to the
present day by the general movement following
the announcement that dinner was served.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>

<p>The dining-room at Fairholme Court, in
the older part of the house, was a long, low
room with casement windows, and carved
beams supporting the ceiling.</p>

<p>In its midst the table sparkled with glass
and silver, arranged with studied care between
the shaded candles in sconces of Sheffield
plate, and the crystal bowls of roses. It had
the look of something exquisite, something in
fact which belonged to Miss Page, and was
marked with her individuality.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dakin made anxious notes. Her
dinner-table never looked a work of art, and
in the intervals of her study of, and speculations
concerning Monsieur Fontenelle, she wondered
why. Several times her glance wandered to
Miss Page, whose eyes were bright, and whose
faint pink colour was rather deeper than usual.</p>

<p>Did the Frenchman she wondered, represent
Miss Page’s romance? It was strange
how little one knew about Miss Page.
Nothing, in fact. Mrs. Dakin realized the fact
for the first time with a little shock of surprise.
But then one never expected Miss Page to
talk about her own affairs. Quite naturally,
inevitably as it seemed, one went to Miss Page
for advice, for sympathy, for encouragement
about one’s self.</p>

<p>But this man must belong to the past life

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
of her hostess, whatever it had been—something
charming, something gentle, since Miss
Page had lived it. Of course she had been
loved. She was too pretty not to have been
loved. Had this man loved her perhaps? If
so, why had they not married?</p>

<p>Mrs. Dakin roused herself, and began to
pay attention to the conversation to which, so
far, she had only contributed mechanical,
unheeding remarks. Indefinitely she felt that
it was on a higher level than usual; the sort
of conversation to which Dymfield was unaccustomed.</p>

<p>The Frenchman talked with the vivacity<ins>,</ins>
the wealth of phrase and imagery common to
his race, and Miss Page talked too, eagerly,
fluently, leaning a little forward, as though
enjoying a much-loved rarely indulged delight.</p>

<p>Dr. Dakin, roused at last from his dreaming,
also sat upright, glancing from one to the
other, throwing in now and again a question
or a comment which was often seized upon
appreciatively to form fresh material for conversation.
Mrs. Dakin sat and wondered,
mystified, scarcely comprehending. The
topics over which the talk ranged, abstract
subjects for the most part, illustrated by
frequent references to books;—novels, French
novels mostly, of which she sometimes just

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
knew the titles, philosophy of which she had
never heard—belonged to a class of ideas
which as yet had never appeared upon her
mental horizon. She was interested, as well
as overwhelmed, by a new view of her hostess.
Miss Page, this brilliant conversationalist, this
subtle reasoner, to whose words the Frenchman,
himself so fluent, such an acute critic and
thinker, accorded a deference so obviously
spontaneous and sincere! Miss Page, who
would spend hours in discussing the organization
of a mothers’ meeting, of a local flower
show, of a Church bazaar. Miss Page, to
whom one applied for recipes for <i lang='fr'>pot pourri</i>,
for dainty invalid dishes, for remedies against
chills. Miss Page, who suggested the fashion
for one’s new summer muslin, and cut out
night-shirts for the children in the Cottage
Hospital!</p>

<p>“How we must bore her!” was Mrs. Dakin’s
involuntary mental exclamation. “And how
well, how delightfully she disguises it,” was
her next reflection.</p>

<p>She remembered other dinners at Fairholme
Court—dinners at which the guests had discussed
the new curate, the latest book of Miss
Marie Corelli, the village cricket match, the
fund for the new organ.</p>

<p>She remembered Miss Page’s gracious

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
charm of manner on these occasions, her
apparent interest in each of these trivial
topics.</p>

<p>Even now, surprised, uncomprehending as
she was with regard to most of the conversation,
she did not fail to remark the tact which
with a word, with a question easy to answer,
she kept three of her guests, at least, ostensibly
within the pale of the conversation.</p>

<p>“It’s quite fair. We are evenly matched,
to-night. Our stupidity has always outweighed
her intelligence before, so she never had a
chance,” thought Mrs. Dakin. The bitterness
of the reflection was caused by the conviction
that it was ignorance, not lack of ability, which
kept her, at least, out of discussions which
interested her. Mrs. Dakin was one of those
women whom mental laziness, not lack of
brain quality, goes far to ruin. Her mind,
naturally active and restless, was unemployed.
She had never trained herself to think.
To-night, with sudden self-recognition, she
regretted both circumstances.</p>

<p>Harry, she noticed it with a curious sensation,
half jealousy, half pride, was not out of
the talk. He was no conversationalist, but he
understood, he appreciated, he contributed.
That his point of view was valuable, she
knew by the brightening of Miss Page’s eyes

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
when he spoke; by an occasional vivacious
affirmative nod from Monsieur Fontenelle.</p>

<p>An idea, odd, staggering in its novelty,
occurred to her.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I bore Harry?”</p>

<p>Never before had this aspect of affairs
presented itself to her consciousness, and the
notion passed like a flash.</p>

<p>The conviction that the exhausting mental
ailment of boredom belonged by right to her
alone, was too firmly established to be upset
by a fugitive ridiculous fancy.</p>

<p>Again she listened.</p>

<p>The Frenchman’s eloquence and vivacity
amused and excited her. He spoke rapidly,
and though the words were English, pronounced
with only the slightest foreign accent,
their use, their handling was French.</p>

<p>Never before, for instance, had she heard
any one utter at length a panegyric such as
that to which she was now listening. It was
evoked by the name of an author of whom she
had never heard, and it was the sort of thing
which in a book she was accustomed to skip.
Spoken with the ease and certainty which
indicated a natural habit of fluent speech, it
amazed and impressed her.</p>

<p>Never before had she guessed that Miss
Page was witty. Wit at Dymfield was not

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
understood; it was ignored, passed over in
silence disapproving because uncomprehended.
Quicker than her neighbours, Mrs. Dakin
realized that in an argument on a play of
Bernard Shaw’s which Monsieur Fontenelle
had recently seen in America, Miss Page was
saying good things. In opposing his view,
her raillery, delicate and ingenious, brought
a frequent smile to his lips, and more than
once an appreciative burst of laughter.</p>

<p>Mr. Carfax, who had never heard of
Bernard Shaw, asked for the story of the
play.</p>

<p>His hostess told it in a few words. That
they were in every respect well chosen, Mrs.
Dakin, who had also never read the works
of the latter-day apostle, guessed from a faint
smile of admiration, which at various points
in the narrative lighted the Frenchman’s face.
Mr. Carfax nodded his head approvingly when
she ceased.</p>

<p>“Very good, I should say. Full of common
sense and right views. We want some one
to elevate the stage; and I’m glad this man,
what’s his name? Ah! Shaw—is a Britisher.
I believe in home-grown literature; something
that expresses the character of the English
people. A fine, sturdy character; the best in
the world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>

<p>Miss Page rose without looking at Monsieur
Fontenelle, whose smile, for greater
safety, had taken refuge in his eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dakin and Mrs. Carfax followed her
into the drawing-room, and as though stricken
with fear lest the dinner-table topics had resulted
in dissatisfaction for her guests, she
moved close to Mrs. Carfax.</p>

<p>“I saw Sylvia, to-day, looking <em>so</em> pretty,”
she began in her gentle, caressing voice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carfax bridled, half pleased, half
unwilling to accept a compliment on behalf
of a daughter who was unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>“Looks don’t matter so much as right
behaviour,” she returned. “She displeases
her father very much with what he calls her
advanced ideas. I don’t know what they are,
I’m sure, except wanting to get away from
a good home. I wish you would speak to her,
Miss Page. She thinks so much of you. You
might bring her to her senses.”</p>

<p>“Poor little Sylvia,” said Miss Page, softly.
“She’s very young, my dear—and she’s a
sweet child at heart. Do ask her to come
to tea with me to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I think your French friend is most interesting,”
remarked Mrs. Dakin, suddenly,
putting down her coffee cup, and taking a
seat beside Anne on the sofa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>

<p>Her hostess turned to her with a pleased
smile.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad. You are always appreciative,
Madge.”</p>

<p>“I never heard any one talk like you two,”
continued Mrs. Dakin, slowly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we talked too much.” The
quick colour sprang to her cheeks. “I hope
you weren’t bored?” She included the two
women in a swift, apologetic glance. “Talking
too much is an old habit of mine, a habit of
long ago, which revives when I see François.
I——” she paused suddenly.</p>

<p>“I was never so interested in my life,” said
Mrs. Dakin, with such obvious sincerity that
Anne’s face cleared.</p>

<p>“Very clever, I’m sure. Very clever,”
murmured Mrs. Carfax. “Tell me, my dear,
what shall I do about Emma? The girl gets
worse and worse. She’s no good at all as a
parlourmaid. I’ve been thinking about her all
dinner-time, and wondering whether I should
give her notice, or whether——”</p>

<p>The entrance of the three men interrupted
the heart-searchings of Mrs. Carfax.</p>

<p>Monsieur Fontenelle stood a moment just
within the door. His eyes fell upon Mrs.
Dakin, who sat in the corner of the sofa,
her slender little figure in its white dress

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
showing to advantage against its coloured
background.</p>

<p>A tremor of pleasure shook her as he drew
up a chair of gilded cane, and leaning over
the arm of the sofa, began to talk to her.</p>

<p>Mr. Carfax and Dr. Dakin, who both made
simultaneously for Miss Page’s corner of the
room, were met by her with a little amused
laugh, to which each responded.</p>

<p>“We can’t <em>both</em> talk to her,” declared Mr.
Carfax, “because of course we each want her
advice.”</p>

<p>“I yield to you,” said the Doctor, characteristically.
“But you mustn’t keep her too
long.”</p>

<p>“Time passes all too quickly with Miss
Page,” returned Mr. Carfax, with his hearty
laugh. “I can make no promises.”</p>

<p>“Do you really want to consult me?” asked
his hostess, turning to him with her flattering
air of undivided, interested attention.</p>

<p>“About many things. There’s that case of
Mrs. O’Malley’s. It’s really very difficult.
Now, what would you advise?” He recounted
at length a conversation he had lately held
with the drunken old woman, on the circumstances
of whose life, though upon this point
she was silent, Miss Page’s knowledge was
considerably fuller than his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>

<p>She listened thoughtfully, and suggested a
different method of attack.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the Vicar, his brow
clearing. “I never thought of that.”</p>

<p>“Anything else?” asked Miss Page.</p>

<p>“Oh well, yes; but I haven’t time for that
now. I must come some other day. I want
to have a long talk with you about Sylvia. I
can’t make the girl out.” He frowned. “She’s
so restless and discontented. I can’t imagine
why she doesn’t settle down and be of some
little assistance to her mother. The girl
annoys me. I have no patience with the
modern shirking of home duties.”</p>

<p>“Dear little Sylvia!” repeated Miss Page.
“She’s coming to tea with me to-morrow. I
always like talking to Sylvia. She’s so pretty
and charming.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carfax looked a little mollified.
“There’s Dakin thinking I’ve overstepped
my time-limit,” he declared. “Come along,
Dakin, your innings now.”</p>

<p>The doctor approached Miss Page’s chair,
a smile on his long thin face.</p>

<p>“I only want you to show me your
latest toys,” he said, glancing at the cabinet.
“I see you have one or two new things
there.”</p>

<p>She rose with alacrity, and in a few

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
moments they were bending over and discussing
a piece of Battersea enamel.</p>

<p>Dr. Dakin, also an enthusiastic collector,
was especially interested in the dainty trifles
of the eighteenth century, which Anne too
loved. It was a period which specially appealed
to him, and the conversation passing
from the frail things they handled—fans painted
on chicken-skin, ivories, patch-boxes—soon extended
to books, many of which he found
Anne possessed.</p>

<p>Their conversation became engrossing, and
Mrs. Dakin turned to her companion with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“My husband is very happy,” she remarked.</p>

<p>“No wonder,” he returned. “Every one
is happy with Miss Page.”</p>

<p>“And she’s so pretty, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“The most beautiful woman of my acquaintance,”
he replied gravely. “Because she has
<em>acquired</em> her beauty—secreted it, in the same
marvellous way that from hidden cells a rose
draws its colour and its sweetness.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dakin glanced at him curiously.
“It takes a Frenchman to say that. But it
describes Miss Page,” she added.</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, curiosity very
strong within her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>

<p>“You have known her a long time? Many
years?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I first met sweet Anne Page twenty years
ago, in this very house.”</p>

<p>He smiled, a quiet reminiscent smile.</p>

<p>“And she wasn’t young even then!”
exclaimed Mrs. Dakin, involuntarily.</p>

<p>“Pardon me. Anne Page was always
young, in the sense that the brooks and
the hawthorn-trees and the roses are always
young.”</p>

<p>The smile was still on his lips, and Mrs.
Dakin blushed.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I know,” she began hurriedly.
“One never thinks of age with regard to her.
I didn’t mean that exactly.”</p>

<p>“He must have been in love with her!”
The idea ran into the undercurrent of her
thoughts. “Perhaps he is still. It would be
awfully romantic. And not absurd at all,”
she added, as a sudden mental supplement.
“Sweet Anne Page is quite pretty.”</p>

<p>Aloud, still impelled by irresistible curiosity,
she went on asking questions.</p>

<p>“But this house didn’t belong to her then,
did it? We haven’t been at Dymfield long
enough, of course, but the old people in the
village remember when Mrs. Burbage lived
here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Burbage! Yes, I’d forgotten. That
was the name.”</p>

<p>“It was quite a romantic story, wasn’t it?”
went on Mrs. Dakin, vivaciously. “You know
it, of course? Miss Page was companion to old
Mrs. Burbage for years before she died. She
had a nephew, and naturally every one imagined
that he would come into the property. But he
displeased her in some way, and she left everything
to Miss Page. At least, so I’m told. Is
it right?”</p>

<p>Monsieur Fontenelle bowed. “I believe
so.” He laughed suddenly. “When I first
knew the house, it was horrible. This beautiful
room, for instance, was full of antimacassars
and wool-work mats. The old lady had—how
do you call it? Mid-Victorian—yes, Mid-Victorian
tastes.”</p>

<p>“Glass shades with wax fruits underneath,
I suppose? Rep curtains and that sort of
thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i lang='fr'>c’était affreux</i>!” he agreed, with a
comic gesture of horror.</p>

<p>“How Miss Page must have enjoyed refurnishing
it! She has such exquisite taste,
hasn’t she? But the garden? The garden
must always have been lovely.”</p>

<p>“It was neglected. Mrs. Burbage was an
invalid—fortunately. For the garden, I mean.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
But Anne had begun to work her magic even
then. The first time I ever saw her she had
been planting roses round a sundial.”</p>

<p>“Oh, in the lavender garden?”</p>

<p>“She took me there this morning. The
rose hedge is very tall now, and the rose
leaves were dropping down on to the sundial”—he
stretched up his arm—“from a height
like this, above it.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Fairholme Court is the most beautiful
place in the neighbourhood. Certainly the
most beautiful place <em>I’ve</em> ever seen.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause, during which
Mrs. Dakin glanced towards the sofa, to which
Anne had returned.</p>

<p>Her green and lavender gown fell in graceful
folds round her feet. Against the cushions
of dim purple at her back, her hair shone with
a sort of moon-lit radiance. The poise of her
head, the smile that wavered constantly near
her sweet mouth, the radiance of her blue eyes,
above all a certain dignity, too gentle to be
quite stately, yet suggesting stateliness, made
her a lovely and a gracious figure.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” said Mrs. Dakin, suddenly,
“what surprises me is that the people
who knew her long ago, when she first came
here, scarcely remember her. They say, ‘Oh,
she was a quiet creature. Very shy. We

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
scarcely noticed her. She was just Mrs.
Burbage’s companion.’ Things like that, you
know. It has often disappointed me. I should
have thought she must have been so beautiful
as a younger woman.”</p>

<p>“She was always beautiful,” said her companion,
quietly, “to those who had eyes to see.
But she has learnt to use her beauty. She
had first to learn that she possessed it. That
took her a long time.” Again he smiled his
odd little smile of reminiscence. “They are
quite right when they say that she was shy.
There are many people in the world, madame,
who could be beautiful if they knew how.
Beauty, the truest beauty, is an art. A subtle
blend of many powers, mental and moral,
which result in a mastery of the physical
qualities. A knowledge of them, a perfect
handling, a moulding of them to the ideal of
the spirit. Do you remember what your critic
Pater, says of <span class='paintings'>Mona Lisa</span>? It is a well-known
passage, but it expresses what I am trying to
say so poorly, so inadequately.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dakin shook her head. “I’m a very
ignorant person,” she said, with an embarrassed
laugh.</p>

<p>“He is speaking of the portrait—which is
lovely, according to the spirit rather than the
flesh, and he says, ‘<cite>It is a beauty wrought out

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
from within upon the flesh, the deposit, little
cell by cell, of strange thoughts and fantastic
reveries, and exquisite passions.</cite>’”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dakin wrinkled her forehead. The
last words shocked her a little. Her plea of
ignorance was a true one in every sense of the
word. It was the plea of a woman who had
passed most of her life with ordinary conventional
people, as oblivious to the complexities
of human life as to the world of ideas in art, in
philosophy, in all the realms invaded by human
thought and emotion.</p>

<p>If her existence was troubled, it was with
the discontent of a child who cries for the
moon which it regards as a pretty material
plaything, rather than the trouble of a woman
to whom the moon is a symbol of the rare, the
exquisite things of life, which she weeps to find
beyond her reach.</p>

<p>Yet her next remark pleased her companion.</p>

<p>“I think what you said about the rose describes
her much better,” she ventured, rather
timidly.</p>

<p>He smiled. “You’re quite right. I see
you understand our sweet Anne Page. She
doesn’t belong to the <span class='paintings'>Mona Lisa</span> type. She’s
made up of all the beautiful natural things; of
the sunlight and the roses, and the dew.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
<i lang='fr'>Tiens!</i> Don’t say I’m ignorant of your poets.
One of them has come rather near it when he
says, ‘<cite>And beauty born of murmuring sound
has passed into her face.</cite>’”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dakin had never heard the lines
before, and hurriedly wondered how she could
find them. She felt flattered, shy, and troubled
at the same moment. It was rather a fearful
joy to be talked to by this Frenchman, who was
evidently so used to what she called “clever”
people, that he quite naturally assumed her
comprehension of his language. She wondered
who <span class='paintings'>Mona Lisa</span> was, and half thought
of asking Harry. It occurred to her that
Harry read a great deal; that his study was
lined with books into which she had never
thought of looking. He never talked to her
about them.</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s because he thinks me too
stupid,” was her impatiently scornful reflection.</p>

<p>She was half relieved, half sorry when Mrs.
Carfax, with a conventional exclamation upon
the lateness of the hour, rose to go.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” she said, holding out her hand
to her companion.</p>

<p>She hesitated, and then, shyness making
the words a little brusque—</p>

<p>“If you are ever here again, I hope Miss
Page will bring you to see us,” she added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span></p>

<p>“<i lang='fr'>Enchanté</i>, madame!” he returned with
his easy bow and smile.</p>

<p>“Delightful fellow that!” exclaimed Dr.
Dakin, as he stepped into the motor-car after
his wife. He spoke with an animation unusual
to him. “It’s been a nice evening, hasn’t it,
Madge?”</p>

<p>“Very,” she returned shortly, pulling the
rug round her, and relapsing into silence.</p>

<p>She was thinking of the Frenchman’s smile,
and of his voice. He had beautiful hands, she
remembered. Her husband looked at her and
sighed a little. He would liked to have discussed
the party, but Madge was in one of her
moods, and he knew that the attempt would be
useless.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“There’s an air of unreality about foreigners,”
remarked Mr. Carfax, pulling up the window
with a jerk, as the hired brougham turned out
of the drive.</p>

<p>“Theatrical, rather—the way that fellow
talked, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Quite absurd,” agreed his wife. “I didn’t
listen. Miss Page is generally more interesting
than she was to-night.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Women do better as a rule, to
keep to the subjects that suit them,” announced
the Vicar. “Not that Miss Page isn’t a

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
clever woman, I believe. At least, Dakin
says so, and <em>he</em> ought to know.”</p>

<p>“I suppose this Monsieur—what’s his
name—was one of the friends she made when
she was travelling?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. She was away long enough
to make shoals of them.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t know her, George, did you,
when you were a young man?”</p>

<p>The Vicar shook his head. “I may have
seen her once or twice when she was old Mrs.
Burbage’s companion. I had just left college
then, and was at my first curacy in Nottingham—just
before we were married, you know.
I came back to the Vicarage once or twice in
those days to see the old Dad, and I suppose
she must have been at Fairholme Court
then. But I don’t remember her. She was
nurse and general factotum to the old lady.
Mrs. Burbage was an eccentric woman, you
know; rather dotty towards the end, I believe.
I can imagine that poor Miss Page hadn’t much
of a life with her.”</p>

<p>“And then directly she had the place left
to her, she shut it up and went away?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That must be nearly twenty years
ago. How time flies!”</p>

<p>“I remember we came to the Vicarage
just after she had gone, when Sylvia was a

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
baby; the year after your father died. It
was a nine-days’ wonder then. And I remember
the people at The Chase saying what
a piece of luck it was for such a dowdy quiet
woman to come into a fortune.”</p>

<p>“They can’t say that now!” observed the
Vicar.</p>

<p>“No. I never was so surprised in my life
as the first time I saw her. That must be ten
years ago now, George?”</p>

<p>“Yes. She was away ten years, and
she’s been back at the Court nearly the same
time. That makes it about twenty years,
as I thought. Dear me, it seems impossible!”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t alter at all, does she? Her
hair may have got a little whiter since I first
saw her, but I believe she’s prettier even.
Well! Foreign travel must be wonderful if
it can change a plain, dowdy creature into a
woman like Miss Page.”</p>

<p>“Money!” exclaimed the Vicar, sententiously.
“Money. It may be the root of
all evil, but it’s a great power—a great power,
Mary.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Dakin’s always very much over-dressed,
isn’t she?” remarked his wife, as
they approached the Vicarage porch.</p>

<p>“Yes. Foolish little woman that—foolish

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
little woman. Take care how you get out,
Mary; the step is awkward.”</p>

<p>The sound of a high sweet voice floated
out upon the darkness, and Mrs. Carfax looked
up sharply at a lighted window on the first
floor.</p>

<p>“There’s Sylvia singing!” she exclaimed
in an exasperated tone. “She’ll wake all the
children. Run up and tell her to stop at once,
George! Really, she is the most annoying
girl I ever met.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II</h2>
</div>


<p><span class='smcap'>Left</span> alone for a few moments while his hostess
was making her farewells in the hall, Monsieur
Fontenelle sat still admiring the beautiful room,
quiet now, its long windows open to the night
and to the sound of the whispering trees.</p>

<p>Lighted by pink-shaded candles, its white
panelled walls, its rose-patterned chintz curtains
and chair-covers gave it an air of exquisite
freshness and purity. Everywhere there were
flowers. Roses glowed between the candles on
the mantelpiece. China bowls filled with sweet
peas, with pink mallows, with snapdragon,
stood on tables, or on the top of Sheraton
bureaus. Even the deep fireplace was filled
with flowering plants.</p>

<p>Appreciatively, Monsieur Fontenelle glanced
at the delicate workmanship of a Chippendale
chair, noticed the graceful shape of a writing-table,
and the beauty of an inlaid bookcase
with a lattice-work of wood over its diamond
panes. There were only one or two pictures
on the walls, whose creamy surface made a

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
restful background to the colour in the room.
Monsieur Fontenelle examined them. His
quick eye detected a Corot, a tiny sketch of
Whistler’s, and then on the wall opposite to
him, a landscape at the sight of which a
peculiar brightness sprang to his eyes.</p>

<p>He crossed the room and stood looking
at it. He was still looking at it when the
rustle of a gown made him aware that Miss
Page had come back.</p>

<p>Then he turned. She was standing just
within the door, watching him, and in her eyes
also there was the same curious brightness.</p>

<p>He looked at her a moment whimsically,
without moving.</p>

<p>“You are a wonderful woman!” he exclaimed
at last, speaking in French.</p>

<p>“Why?” she returned in the same language.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I leave that to the <i lang='fr'>bon Dieu</i> who made
you. He’s responsible, I suppose, for women
of your type.”</p>

<p>She smiled without replying.</p>

<p>“You tell me you’re happy?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Quite happy, François.”</p>

<p>Again he shrugged his shoulders. “Come,
let us talk,” he said, taking her by both hands
and leading her to the sofa. “I only saw you
for ten minutes this morning.”</p>

<p>“Let us talk,” she replied. And in French,
“<i lang='fr'>Ça me fera du bien</i>.”</p>

<p>Instead of speaking at first, he looked at
her.</p>

<p>“Anne,” he exclaimed after a moment,
“you are amazing! How do you manage it?
You look younger than the day I first saw you.”</p>

<p>“But I was old then,” she returned, shaking
her head—“very old. A woman who had done
with life.”</p>

<p>He answered her seriousness with a slow
smile.</p>

<p>“Life had not done with you, had it?”</p>

<p>She did not reply, and with a change of
voice, he said—</p>

<p>“So these are your neighbours.”</p>

<p>“Some of them. They are dear people.
I can’t tell you half their kindness to me.”</p>

<p>“It’s not difficult to be kind to sweet Anne
Page.”</p>

<p>She gave him a quick glance. “It’s nice to
hear the old name again.”</p>

<p>“No name ever suited a woman better.
So you can live with the inhabitants of Dymfield
without boring yourself to extinction?
But of course you can. I never saw you
bored.”</p>

<p>“Boredom is a modern disease, isn’t it?
And you know I am not a modern woman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span></p>

<p>“Thank God!” he exclaimed with fervour.
“The little woman whose pretty head I’ve
been puzzling all the evening, suffers from it
terribly, though.”</p>

<p>“Boredom? You’re very quick, François.
You always were. Poor little thing!” she
added with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Why? Doesn’t her husband amuse her?”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “No. It’s one of
those unnecessary tragedies of life. They
don’t try to understand one another. The
material for happiness is all there, and they
miss it. He’s a dear fellow. Kind, and good;
and a scholar too, as of course you discovered.”</p>

<p>“Yes. You have one person at least with
whom you need not talk in words of one
syllable.”</p>

<p>“Words of one syllable are often the
sweetest.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “You remind me of the lady
from whose lips whenever she opened them,
a flower fell. Your floors ought to be strewn
with roses and violets by this time. But come!
I don’t want to discuss your neighbours. I
want to talk about you. Do you know that
in ten years I have only seen you three times?
And you must have been through Paris very
often. What have you to say for yourself?”</p>

<p>“Twice when I went to your studio you

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
were away. The last time, the <i lang='fr'>concièrge</i> told
me you were with a lady.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well I didn’t come up, of course.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “Anne! You are the same
Anne. So demure—so discreet.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would have married by
this time, François,” she said after a moment.</p>

<p>He shook his head. “No dear Anne, you
didn’t. You know I am not the man to
marry.”</p>

<p>She returned his glance. “You are right,”
she answered quietly. “You have become
such a celebrity François, that I ought to be
afraid of you,” she added.</p>

<p>His face changed. “I have become a
popular painter, you mean.”</p>

<p>“You are not satisfied?” She put the
question softly.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “One becomes
what one is fit to become. I’m a lazy devil,
Anne. It wasn’t in me to bear the heat and
burden of the day without my hire. I have
learnt to give the public what it wants, and to
laugh in my sleeve at its stupid shouting.
The result is that in every paper the world
is assured that I have achieved an international
reputation. And next week I shall stand at
the head of a staircase, solemnly shaking by

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
the hand, innumerable stupid people who
know nothing, and care less about art, but
have come because it is one of the functions
of the season, to stare at the President of the
International Art Congress. <i lang='fr'>Quelle farce!</i>”</p>

<p>He laughed a little. “It seems far enough
away from that summer twenty years ago, when
we all sat in that garden,” he nodded towards
the open window, “and talked of our dreams
and our ambitions. Ah! we were going to
revolutionize art, weren’t we? We were going
to bring the world to our feet like the young
painters in <i lang='fr'>L’Oeuvre</i>, do you remember? The
young painters who used to walk about Paris,
talking, for ever talking, mad with hope and
enthusiasm. And now? Henri is writing
for <i lang='fr'>La Presse ... Sacré tonnerre de Dieu</i>, as
Lantier and Sandoz used to remark so frequently.
What stuff! And how it pays!
(Henri has a flat, Rue Malesherbes—Empire
right through.) Paul has abandoned music, and
is making vast sums on the Bourse, and I am
President of the International Art Congress.”</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>“And René is dead,” said Anne.</p>

<p>There was a silence. The lamp-lit room
with its colour and fragrance was very still.
To both of them, their minds filled with the
scenes of other days, it assumed for a moment

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
an air of brilliant unreality, like a room seen in
a dream. Outside, the trees whispered very
softly.</p>

<p>“Whom the gods love——” began François.</p>

<p>He rose abruptly, and moved to the picture
he had been examining when Anne
entered.</p>

<p>“That’s the real stuff!” he exclaimed.
“God! how good it is! How did you get
this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I bought it.”</p>

<p>He wheeled abruptly round. “Have you
much of his work?”</p>

<p>“I bought all I could get. <cite>The Bathers</cite>
and <cite>The Forest</cite> are in my room upstairs.”</p>

<p>“Then France is the poorer by three
masterpieces.”</p>

<p>“France will get them back at my death.”</p>

<p>“You have arranged that?”</p>

<p>She nodded. “They belong to his country,
of course.”</p>

<p>He came and sat beside her again. “I
told you that the Luxembourg had bought my
portrait of you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Dear François the news gave me
more pleasure than anything I have heard
about you for a long time.”</p>

<p>“It was to be my masterpiece, if you
remember. They’re quite right. I’ve never

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
done anything to touch it since. It belongs to
my youth.”</p>

<p>He saw that she was pale, and that her
eyes looked sad.</p>

<p>“I’ve distressed you. I’m a brute!” he
declared impulsively. “And we’re not all
<i lang='fr'>hommes ratés</i>, thank Heaven! Some of the
men of the old Rue de Fleurus days are not
to be despised.”</p>

<p>“Thouret, Bussières, Giroux,” murmured
Anne.</p>

<p>“Yes; they have big names now. But
after all Anne, it’s you who have made an
art of <em>life</em>. You’re the only real success. You
and René—who was wise enough to die,” he
added.</p>

<p>“Talk to me about Paris,” Anne urged.
“What is your new studio like? Very
gorgeous, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“It’s the studio of a popular portrait-painter.
Now you know all about it.”</p>

<p>“And the Duclos? And Georges
Pasteurs?”</p>

<p>He began to talk gaily, while she questioned
him, and they both laughed at reminiscences.
There was no end to her eager
inquiries.</p>

<p>“How you remember the people!” exclaimed
François, presently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span></p>

<p>“How can I forget?” she asked.</p>

<p>It was late when he rose to go.</p>

<p>“To-morrow, early I start for London, to
prepare for the fuss of next week. I’m glad
you won’t be there, Anne.”</p>

<p>His whimsical mocking smile met her as
she raised her eyes.</p>

<p>“I should prefer you not to see your old
friend playing the solemn fool.”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “Well! One
can’t have everything, and I have five thousand
a year. It’s enough to make one comfortable.”</p>

<p>“But not happy,” she said gently.</p>

<p>“That, till forty, depends on one’s temperament.
Afterwards on one’s dinner. I’m very
happy to-night. Your cook was chosen with
your usual discretion.<ins>”</ins></p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“You will be coming through Paris this
winter?”</p>

<p>“Not to stay. Paris hurts me a little, old
woman as I am. On my way back, in the
spring perhaps.”</p>

<p>He kissed her hand. “Most certainly in
the spring. It’s <i lang='fr'>au revoir</i>.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III">III</h2>
</div>


<p><span class='smcap'>An</span> hour after her friend had gone, Miss Page
sat by the open window in her bedroom. The
room was full of moonlight, for she had put out
the candles and drawn back the curtains.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the garden, or near it, a
nightingale was singing.</p>

<p>Deep shadows lay across the lawn, and
all the trees were dreaming. Far out, the
meadows covered with a light mist, were like
a mystic silver-flooded sea.</p>

<p>For a long time Anne did not move. Her
long talk had revived memories. They
crowded so swiftly to her mind that she grew
bewildered, and as though impelled by a
sudden impulse to seek relief, she rose and
crossed the room to a tall bureau opposite the
window.</p>

<p>Its interior revealed a number of pigeonholes,
and tiny cupboards with brass knobs.
Pressing a spring under one of these, a deep
drawer sprang open.</p>

<p>She felt in its recesses for a moment, and

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
presently drew out a book bound in a linen
cover. Then lighting a candle and placing
it on the table near the window, she resumed
her seat.</p>

<p>In the quiet air the candle flame burnt clear
and steady, and opening the book, Anne began
to read a journal begun in her childhood. The
volume was an ordinary thick exercise book
such as schoolgirls use, and on the first page,
in a large childish hand, was written—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class='address'>
    <p>“<cite>Anne Page</cite>,</p>
    <p class='pl1' >“<cite>Tufton Street</cite>,</p>
    <p class='pl4h'>“<cite>Dalston</cite>,</p>
    <p class='pl6' >“<cite>London, 18—</cite>.</p>
</div>

<p class='cb'>“This is my birthday,” it began. “I am
twelve to-day, and I have made up my mind
to keep a diary like Charlotte and Emily and
Anne Brontë. At least I think they didn’t
exactly keep a diary. They wrote down what
they were all doing at a certain time, and then
four years afterwards, they opened their papers
and compared notes. I think that was a good
plan. But I shall write in my book once a
year, on my birthday. So few things happen
to me that I dare say that will be quite enough.</p>

<p>“As I have never written a journal before,
I will say all I can remember about myself
before this birthday. Perhaps if I don’t, I
shall have forgotten it by the time I’m old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span></p>

<p>“I live at Dalston, and father is one of the
curates at St. Jude’s. Mother died when I
was two years old, so I don’t remember her.
She left me her watch and chain and two
bracelets. I have one brother Hugh, but last
year he ran away from home, and went to sea.
He ran away because he wasn’t happy. Father
was very strict with him. It is a good thing to
be a boy, and be able to run away. I can’t,
because girls can’t be sailors, and there’s
nowhere to run to. I miss Hugh dreadfully.
He was fourteen, and he was very nice to me.
I still cry about him sometimes at night. But
it’s no good.</p>

<p>“Our house is very ugly. It’s in a street.
It has a little back garden, but nothing will
grow there because it’s full of cats.</p>

<p>“I have a governess. Her name is Miss
Atkins. She comes every day at half-past
nine, and gives me lessons till twelve. Then
we go for a walk. But there are no nice walks
here. In the afternoon I do needlework, and
learn my lessons for the next day, and Miss
Atkins goes at six o’clock. She has corkscrew
curls, and her hair is sandy like Thomas, our
cat. She is cross every arithmetic day, because
I can’t do arithmetic. But she says it’s because
I won’t, but that is not true. I like history and
poetry, and all about the poets and writers.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
And especially Shakespeare. Sometimes I
read out of Lamb’s tales for my reading lesson.
I should like to read out of Shakespeare, but
Miss Atkins won’t let me. She says it isn’t
fit. I don’t know why she says this, because I
have found a Shakespeare in father’s study,
and some of it is beautiful. I like the
Midsummer-Night’s Dream, and Romeo and
Juliet. The Shakespeare is the only nice
book in the house. Most of them are
sermons, and about religion.</p>

<p>“I’m going to put a wicked thing in this
book, so I must be careful always to lock it up.
<em>I don’t like religion.</em></p>

<p>“Miss Atkins says she loves God, and I
asked her whether father did. She was
shocked, and said of course he did, because
he was a curate. I wish he loved <em>me</em>, but I
don’t think he does. He is nearly always
cross, and I’m always being punished.”</p>
</div>

<p>Miss Page let the book fall on to her lap.
Mechanically she turned her face towards the
meadows with their islands of motionless trees
emerging from the mists. But she did not see
them. The childish words, already considerably
more than forty years old, already a little
yellow and faded, had brought into sight
instead, the dreary house in Tufton Street.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
With the clearness and precision of actual
vision, she saw the narrow staircase covered
with oilcloth, which led up to the bedroom in
which she had spent so many hours of solitary
confinement.</p>

<p>She saw the pattern on the shabby wall-paper.
She saw her little iron bedstead,
covered with a counterpane of thick white
material, with a raised pattern upon its surface;
the curtains of dingy drab rep on either side
of a red blind; the outlook across a leaden
street, swept by wind and rain.</p>

<p>She thought of her father, a morose, irritable
man whose persistent bad temper, condoned
to himself under the guise of necessary chastisement,
had driven her brother from the house.</p>

<p>She remembered him in the clothes of his
office, shabby and ill-cut, going doggedly
about the duties which in later years she knew
had been uncongenial.</p>

<p>Half reluctantly Anne took up the book
again.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I said that nothing ever happened to me.
But one lovely thing happened last year. I
went to stay at Dymfield, with Mr. and Mrs.
Burbage. Mr. Burbage was some relation to
my mother—a cousin, I think. Anyhow they
wrote to father, and asked him to let me come.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
Their house is called Fairholme Court, and it
is a lovely house, only the furniture is ugly
(except upstairs in some of the bedrooms,
where Mrs. Burbage can’t see it). Mrs. Burbage
is very funny. She was kind to me, and
I liked her rather, but not nearly so much as
Mr. Burbage. I liked him better than any one
I ever saw, though he doesn’t talk much, but
reads all day long. Perhaps that’s what makes
his eyes look so tired and sad. He has a
lovely study full of books, and he let me read
anything I liked. It was there that I read
about Charlotte and Emily and Anne Brontë.
They are very interesting, but I wish Emily
had been called Anne, like me, instead of the
youngest one. I like Emily best. And I read
Hans Andersen too, and when I came away
Mr. Burbage gave it to me. It is the loveliest
book in the world. My favourite story is
‘The Little Sea Maid.’ Some day when
I am grown up, I will go to places where there
are orange trees, and marble palaces, and the
sea is quite blue.</p>

<p>“My bedroom was so pretty. It was like
a room in a fairy-tale. There was furniture
with spindly legs in it; the kind of furniture
Mrs. Burbage said was ugly and old-fashioned.
But I thought it was very pretty. There were
white curtains to the bed, and the wall-paper

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
had pink rosebuds on it, and the window was
like a little door with lots of tiny panes, and
it pushed outwards. There was clematis all
round the window, and white roses which tried
to grow into the room. In the morning I used
to hear the birds chirping in their nests, and
then I used to jump out of bed, and see the
sun rising over the fields. And the garden
was all shining with dew, and everything look
<em>enchanted</em>.</p>

<p>“I was there a month, while Miss Atkins
was away for her holiday, and I was <em>too</em> happy.
But now I shall never go there again, because
father has had a quarrel with Mr. Burbage.
It was something about me, I think.”</p>
</div>

<p>Her eyes still fixed on the round handwriting,
Anne’s memory was working.</p>

<p>Years later she knew that her old friend had
once loved her mother, his cousin and playfellow.
At her father’s death she had found,
on going through his papers, the letter in which
he had offered to provide for the child of the
woman who would not be his wife. It was
a letter full of tact and delicate feeling, but
it indicated how much of the little girl’s loneliness
he knew and understood.</p>

<p>He pointed out that companions of her own
age were necessary for the happy development

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
of her temperament. He wanted to educate
her with some neighbour’s children, so that
she might live at Fairholme Court, in the
country which she loved. She was not strong,
he declared, and London air obviously did not
suit her. There would of course be no
attempt to separate her from her father. She
could return to him during the holidays, whenever
he wished to see her.</p>

<p>It was a letter written from full knowledge
of the circumstances.</p>

<p>He knew the atmosphere of struggling
poverty in which Anne, as the daughter of
a curate with an income of little more than
a hundred a year, passed her existence. He
knew also that the man had little tenderness
for his daughter, and he hoped that his
suggestion might come as a relief.</p>

<p>Even at the age of twelve, Anne could
have undeceived him.</p>

<p>Already, unable as yet to put her knowledge
into definite form, she knew her father
well.</p>

<p>Gloomy and morose, a man of narrow
intelligence and invincible obstinacy, he resented
any overtures which to his mind
savoured of patronage.</p>

<p>In later years Anne knew the bitterness
of his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span></p>

<p>The son of a rich stockbroker, he had just
finished his course at Cambridge when the
financial ruin, which killed his father, struck
the death-blow to his own ambitions also.</p>

<p>He had been reading for the Church, with
dreams, easy as it then seemed to be realized,
of a splendid living, and a possible bishopric.</p>

<p>The girl to whom he was engaged, the
daughter of an impoverished Irish landlord,
was penniless.</p>

<p>She refused to give him up, and he married
her, after taking orders, and entering the Church
as a miserably paid curate. Together they
settled in the dingy little house near the Church
of St. Jude, at Dalston, to prove that love in
poverty was a different matter from the same
emotion experienced in affluence.</p>

<p>Henry Page was not strong enough to
bear misfortune well.</p>

<p>His temper, naturally irrational and impatient
of hardship—a temper which it would
have required much material prosperity to
soften, became soured and exacting under the
stress of daily anxious necessity. Five years
after their marriage, his young wife, crushed
and saddened, gave up the struggle and died,
leaving her two children in no very gentle
hands.</p>

<p>The boy, determined to call his life his

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
own, had cut the knot of uncongenial family
existence by flight.</p>

<p>Anne was left.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Miss Page turned over the leaves of the
exercise book slowly.</p>

<p>On the whole, the child she remembered
had kept her resolution fairly well.</p>

<p>“<em>To-day is my birthday. I am thirteen.
I am fifteen. I am seventeen.</em>” The words
marking another year met her eyes constantly
as she fluttered the pages. Several times
there was a mention of Hugh. She had heard
from him. He was getting on. He hoped
some day to be captain of a trading vessel.
He had sent her some funny writing-paper
from Japan. Another time it was a pressed
flower, or some curious seeds from the South
Sea Islands.</p>

<p>Once—this was recorded after her seventeenth
birthday—he had come home for a week.</p>

<p>“He is nineteen, and so brown and handsome
and strong,” was the remark in the
journal. “He did not get on well with father.
He told him that I ought to go away—that
I had no friends, and that my life was very
dull. Father was terribly angry. Now Hugh
has gone, and I’m wretched—<em>wretched</em>. The
house is so quiet. I can hear the clock in

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
the hall ticking even when I’m upstairs in my
bedroom. It is raining, and the sky is like
lead.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Anne still turned the leaves. There were
big gaps in the journal, but if they had been
filled, the word across the page would have been
the classic <em>nothing</em> of the diary of Louis XVI.</p>

<p>In thought Anne went back over the long,
dreary years—the incredibly empty years of
a woman whom lack of means as well as lack
of opportunity cuts off from the world.</p>

<p>A woman moreover, whose youth was
spent under conditions less elastic, less favourable
to development than those of modern days.</p>

<p>The cold bare nave of St. Jude’s rose
vividly in her mind. She saw the pews full
of women in frowsy faded bonnets—the bonnets
of Dalston.</p>

<p>She saw the parish room lighted by unshaded
gas-burners, in which, shy as she was,
she had held classes for work-girls. Again
she watched them bending over their desks,
giggling and nudging one another when she
entered the room.</p>

<p>She remembered the look of the street
when after the appointed hour for her class,
she emerged from the stuffy room into the
night air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span></p>

<p>There was a butcher’s shop opposite, with
a row of flaring lights, and the butcher in a
greasy apron used to stand upon the pavement
shouting his wares to the hurrying
passers-by.</p>

<p>Then there was the return to the dingy
house. A hurried lighting of the gas in the
entrance passage, the glare of which revealed
the oil-cloth on the floor, growing more worn
and shabby every year. How well Anne
remembered what was left of the pattern of
that oil-cloth!</p>

<p>A descent into the kitchen followed, where
she prepared the supper, and directed the
clumsy movements of Harriet, the little maid-of-all-work.</p>

<p>Supper then with her father, who sometimes
scarcely raised his head from his plate,
and seldom spoke a word.</p>

<p>Anne remembered one or two of the curates
who had tried to make friends with her.</p>

<p>One of them who sometimes insisted upon
walking back with her from her evening class,
had hovered upon the verge of a mild flirtation.
But to Anne, desperately shy and unused to
the society of her fellow-creatures, his words
were meaningless and embarrassing. Moreover,
her father was unpopular. Frequently
embroiled with his colleagues, none of them

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
sought his society, and none ventured to a
house to which they were never invited.</p>

<p>In retrospect, she scarcely needed aid from
the journal, Anne saw the years pass in grey
procession. There was no note of revolt in the
record of her girlhood’s days, and the reading
was the sadder for its absence. No revolt, no
bitterness. Only a sad acquiescence with fate,
a gradual numbing of sensation, a sort of
mental and moral apathy, grey, leaden, hopeless.</p>

<p>She paused at the words which followed the
announcement of her twenty-seventh birthday.</p>

<p>“Last week father was taken suddenly
very ill. The doctor is afraid it is paralysis.”</p>

<p>For three years there was no further word
in the book, but Anne knew those three years
by heart.</p>

<p>They were passed chiefly between the sick-room
and the kitchen, in which she prepared
invalid food, and directed the little maid in the
management of the housework. Helpless as a
child, her father required constant unremitting
attendance, and when on the eve of her
thirtieth birthday he died, Anne found herself
literally penniless. The long illness had
swallowed up his scanty earnings, and, unprepared
for any work in the world, his daughter
was left to face starvation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span></p>

<p>Fastened inside the book was the letter
which saved her.</p>

<p>It was written in the thin, quavering handwriting
of an old woman even then ill and
feeble. She opened and read it.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

    <p>“Fairholme Court,</p>

</div>

<p class='cb'>“<cite>My dear Anne</cite>,</p>

<p class='double-indent'>“<cite>The news of your loss has just reached
me. Before he died, my husband made me
promise that if you were ever free, I would
ask you to come to me. Will you come now?
I am an old woman, and an invalid. In any
case, before long I <span id='c55'>must have <del>had</del> a companion</span>
who would look after me, and nurse me when
necessary. I cannot offer you a very cheerful
home, but if you come you will be welcome.</cite></p>

<p>“<cite>With sincere sympathy for the grief you
have sustained</cite>,</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='cb'>On the next page, the last written page
in the book, Anne read these words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To-morrow I go to Fairholme Court. It
is eighteen years since I saw it. I am now
thirty years old, and what I said as a child

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
is still true. Nothing has ever happened to
me. Nothing will ever happen now. It is
not surprising. I am very plain, and nothing
happens to a plain woman who is also poor.
I ought to be very grateful to Mrs. Burbage.
She has probably saved me from starving. I
<em>am</em> very grateful. But to-night I can’t feel
anything except that I don’t care to go on
living. If I were a religious woman I should
think this sinful, but what I said as a child
is still true. I don’t like religion. I mean
that it has never affected me. Never made
me happy. Perhaps I have never yet found
the religion to suit me. I don’t know. To-morrow
I begin a new life, but it will be again
a life of nursing.</p>

<p>“I try to be grateful for a home. I try to
feel cheerful. But all feeling seems to have
gone. I remember my thoughts as a child.
I was often very eager then, and hopeful. I
was often sure in my heart that something
delightful would happen to me. But now
nothing seems worth while, and I am only
very tired. Perhaps when I feel better I shall
be glad that Fairholme Court is beautiful and
in the country. To-night even that doesn’t
matter.</p>

<p>“Hugh wrote to me after father’s death.
He has saved a little money, and with

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
another man, a friend, he is going to start a
sheep farm in New Zealand. He is engaged
to be married to a girl he met on one of his
voyages. She has since returned to England,
and they will have to wait till he has made
a home for her before they can marry. But he
seems full of hope, and is very happy.</p>

<p>“I am chiefly thankful for Mrs. Burbage’s
invitation, because now I need not be a burden
to him. As it is, he has sent me money which
he can ill afford, though without it I could not
have existed during the past few months. He
wanted my photograph, and, to please him,
I had it taken. The other copies will be
wasted. There’s no one else in the world who
wants my picture. All my things are packed.
This is the end of my life here. I wish it were
the end altogether.”</p>
</div>

<p>A photograph, one of the wasted copies,
was placed between the leaves, at the last
written page.</p>

<p>Anne took it up, and examined it by the
light of the expiring candle.</p>

<p>She saw a sad quiet face, with thick hair
parted smoothly on either side of the forehead.
It was a face which looked older than the one
now bent over it. A disfiguring gown, fastened
with a little tucker at the neck, concealed the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
long line of the throat. Except for the indication
of a clear cut chin, and a mouth sweet,
despite its sadness, there was no beauty, not
even a suggestion of grace or charm in the
picture.</p>

<p>Anne replaced the photograph, and slowly
shut the book.</p>

<p>There was a look of terror on her face.
She had called up a ghost—the ghost of her
past self.</p>

<p>Like a woman whose one idea is flight,
she half rose, and for a moment glanced with
frightened eyes about the room.</p>

<p>Dawn was breaking. The eerie, grey light
showed her the embroidered linen coverlet
on her bed, the spindle-legged dressing-table
which had once stood in the little white bedroom
upstairs, the flowered curtains at the
window, the bowl of sweet peas on the table at
which she had been sitting.</p>

<p>She drew a deep breath, and moved close
to the window.</p>

<p>The air thrilled with the voices of the birds.
The trees were still motionless, as though
waiting for the sun; and grey with dew, the
meadows stretched away towards the dim
horizon. In the rose-garden on the right,
beneath the sheltering wall, the sun-dial
glimmered white as pearl in the dawn-light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span></p>

<p>The candle flared up, and went out with
a flicker.</p>

<p>Anne turned, and groping her way in the
half light, replaced the book in the drawer, and
touched the spring which closed it.</p>

</div>


<p><span class='smcap'>At</span> four o’clock, Sylvia Carfax swung the gate
of the Vicarage garden behind her, and stepped
into the dusty road.</p>

<p>It was nearly a mile to Fairholme Court,
and the sun blazed in a sky of cloudless blue,
and beat upon her shoulders protected only by
a blouse of thin muslin.</p>

<p>Sylvia was just twenty, tall slim, and, as
Miss Page suggested very pretty.</p>

<p>In her own mind Anne often wondered
when she looked at the girl’s rich black hair,
which made such a striking contrast to eyes
blue as the sky, that from the shelter of
the Vicarage and all it represented such a
southern, opulent type of beauty should have
emerged.</p>

<p>To reach her destination Sylvia had to
walk through the village, past the blacksmith’s,
and past the baker’s shop, with its quaint
carving over the entrance porch.</p>

<p>Dymfield was an ideally beautiful village,
to which even the doctor’s motor-car scarcely

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
brought more than a hint of the rush and hurry
and ugliness of much of modern life.</p>

<p>In the gardens of the thatched cottages,
summer flowers made a blaze of colour. Roses
and honeysuckle clambered over porch and
roof.</p>

<p>The church, resting peacefully in the green
sea of the churchyard, was like some great
rock, stained with lichen, crumbling with age,
beautiful in its decay.</p>

<p>Near it, under the shade of mighty elms,
was a row of almshouses, fine specimens of
black-and-white work, and at the end of the
rambling street stood the old well, with its
canopy of wrought iron, and its ancient moss-grown
steps.</p>

<p>As she passed through the village in
which from babyhood she had lived, Sylvia
recognized its beauty and its peace. It seemed
a place where it was always afternoon, and for
that reason, to the girl who yearned for the
morning, herself in the glad confident morning
of life, it was intolerable.</p>

<p>She gave herself an impatient little shake,
and hurried on.</p>

<p>Now, across the green, the beeches of
Fairholme Court were in sight.</p>

<p>In summer they almost completely screened
the house, and made deep shadows in the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
drive. Thankfully Sylvia plunged into the
shade and quickened her steps.</p>

<p>The hall door was wide open, revealing
the coolness of the white-panelled hall, and as
she entered, the air was sweet with the scent
of flowers.</p>

<p>She stopped a moment to bend over a
great bowl of sweet peas.</p>

<p>“Everything is peaceful here too,” she
thought. “But it’s interesting as well. I
wonder why?”</p>

<p>The appearance of Burks, immaculate as
usual in snowy cap and apron, interrupted her
vague musing.</p>

<p>“Mistress is upstairs in her sitting-room.
I’ll tell her you’re here, miss.”</p>

<p>“Thank you Burks, she expects me. I’ll
go up.”</p>

<p>The maid disappeared, and Sylvia ran up
the shallow stairs to the first floor, and knocked
at a door on the right.</p>

<p>“Ah! my dear child!”</p>

<p>Anne half rose from a couch which was
placed close to the window.</p>

<p>The matting blinds outside were half drawn
to keep out the glare of the sun, and the room
was filled with a light soft and green, as though
it had filtered through a canopy of leaves.
Beneath the blinds one caught a glimpse of

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
one of the rose-gardens. Protected by a yew
hedge, roses of all colours lifted their sweet,
hot faces to the sun. A grass path running
down the middle of the garden ended at a
white seat, in a bower of white blossom.</p>

<p>Sylvia drew a deep breath. “I believe all
the delicious scents in the world are here!”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“That’s why I like this room in the afternoon,”
said Anne. “The sun draws all the
sweetness out of the roses, and sends it up
here. Take off your hat, my child. You’ve
had a tiring walk, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“I’d walk twenty miles in the sun to find
you at the end of them,” declared Sylvia,
vehemently.</p>

<p>Anne laughed, as she got up and rang the
bell for tea.</p>

<p>Her white wrapper of cambric and lace
trailed after her as she moved. Sylvia touched
it with reverent fingers.</p>

<p>“You look so sweet in these things,” she
said.</p>

<p>“I ought to have changed my gown properly
to receive you. But I was reading, and
too lazy to move.”</p>

<p>Sylvia picked up the book which lay on the
sofa.</p>

<p>“French, I see by the yellow cover.” She

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
began to turn over the leaves, and suddenly
laughed.</p>

<p>“How like you to have a rose-leaf for a
book-marker! <em>I</em> should put in a hairpin, or
something equally ugly. I wish I could read
French easily, then you would lend me all your
books, wouldn’t you, Miss Page?”</p>

<p>“Not all of them,” returned Anne, smiling.</p>

<p>“Why not? I’m sure <em>you</em> haven’t got
stupid ideas about proper reading for young
girls, and all that sort of thing,” declared
Sylvia, petulantly.</p>

<p>“I’ve got ideas on the subject, stupid or
otherwise. Tea, please Burks. We’ll have
it up here. And bring the pink tea-service.
It goes so nicely with this room,” she explained
to Sylvia in parenthesis.</p>

<p>“Do tell me why you wouldn’t lend me all
your novels?” the girl persisted.</p>

<p>“Because certain books<ins>,</ins> my dear<ins>,</ins> are of
no use to us till life makes them intelligible.
And life can only be learnt by living it.”</p>

<p>“I wish I’d lived it then,” protested Sylvia.</p>

<p>“Oh Sylvia, there’s time enough. Don’t
wish that,” returned Miss Page, quickly. She
bent forward and took the girl’s hand. “Don’t
wish your youth away. It goes so fast in any
case. And it should be the most beautiful
part of one’s life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span></p>

<p>“<em>Should be!</em>” replied Sylvia, passionately.
“But is it? What’s the good of my youth to
me, here in this dull little hole? I’d give the
world to be like you, Miss Page. You’re not—not
quite young, perhaps——”</p>

<p>“My dear, I’m almost an old woman.”</p>

<p>Her smile was wistful, though it was
touched with amusement.</p>

<p>“You’ll never be that!” returned Sylvia,
vehemently. “And anyhow, you’re lovely,
and every one adores you. And you lead
your own life and make it beautiful. And
I’m perfectly certain that you <em>have</em> had everything
I want. Except that you’re not married.
I suppose I shall want to be married some time
or other. But, then, as you didn’t marry it
must have been because you didn’t want to.
Hundreds of men must have been dying to
marry you. I’m sure hundreds are dying
now——”</p>

<p>“What an awful picture of carnage!”
interrupted Anne, laughing, as Burks appeared
with the tea.</p>

<p>“What a <em>lovely</em> tea-service!” Sylvia exclaimed,
taking up one of the Sèvres cups
gently to examine it. “But then everything
of yours is lovely. This room is as perfect
as the drawing-room, and I think I like it
almost better. I love the white matting on

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
the floor, and these green-and-white chair-covers
and curtains. And I love a room lined
with books. What a lot!”</p>

<p>She began to walk round examining them.
“But heaps of them are French ones, so you
needn’t be afraid,” she added mischievously.
“Oh, and Italian too! Do you read Italian,
Miss Page? Really? I ought to be afraid
of you. You’re so awfully clever. I believe
you keep everything you love best up here,
don’t you? The pictures now—I don’t understand
pictures, but I like the colour of these.
This room seems more <em>you</em> than all the rest of
the house. Though it’s all like you in a
way.”</p>

<p>“I only receive my <em>special</em> visitors up
here.”</p>

<p>Anne’s smile flattered and touched the girl.</p>

<p>She slipped down on to the sofa beside her
friend, and moved close to her with a caressing
movement, as she took the tea-cup from her
hand.</p>

<p>“These cakes were baked expressly for
you, so you must do them justice. Really
cook makes them very prettily, doesn’t she?
They’re rather like the cakes in <cite>Goblin
Market</cite>. Do you remember how the sisters</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>
<p>She passed them to Sylvia in their silver
basket, over the rim of which fell a d’oyley
of fine lace and linen.</p>

<p>Sylvia shook her head. “I don’t know
anything!” she exclaimed. “I shall never
know anything if I stay here. Oh Miss
Page, <em>do</em> help me to get away! You can do
anything with father. Please persuade him
that I ought to go. You know how it is at
home. I’m not really wanted. We’re quite
comfortably off, and there are enough servants
to do the work without <em>making</em> work for me, to
try to keep me quiet when I’m aching to go
and make my own life!”</p>

<p>She pushed her cup away from her with an
impatient movement.</p>

<p>Anne waited a moment. “It’s still the
music, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I <em>have</em> got a voice. I know I could
do something with it. And you see they don’t
understand. Mother says I can take lessons
from Miss Rowe at Dorminster. <em>Miss Rowe!</em>”
She laughed derisively. “And father says if
I sing well enough to please them at home,
and to lead in the choir, what more do I
want? They expect me to trot round with
mother on her district calls, when I’m really
only in the way. Mother <em>likes</em> doing it. She
wouldn’t give up her work to me even if I

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
wished it. And I’m supposed to do needlework
for the children, when poor Mrs. Jones
down the village would be glad of it, and
ought to have it. And they think I’m awful
and ungrateful not to be quite happy with
tennis parties and flower shows for my
amusement! Oh Miss Page, don’t you think
to be a daughter at home, with no money,
at the mercy of your parents, unable to get
away, is just like being a slave?”</p>

<p>She poured out the words passionately.
Her hands were shaking, her eyes full of tears.</p>

<p>Anne looked at her, and a wave of comprehension
and pity passed over her heart.</p>

<p>The girl’s incoherent words were echoes;
they touched painful memories of years for her,
long past.</p>

<p>She recognized the despairing cry of youth,
articulate in these modern times, no longer
stifled as in the days of her own girlhood.</p>

<p>Youth, fettered, struggling with passionate
clamour to be free.</p>

<p>She recognized the revolt of a temperament
unsuited to its environment, bound by
a tyranny no less stifling because it was unconscious
and even loving.</p>

<p>She rose, and began to walk about the
room, conscious of the modern spirit, accepting
it as inevitable, and in spite of all the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
misery it involved, right in its essence, a
necessary step towards the just claim for
individual liberty.</p>

<p>Sylvia watched her hungrily, like a prisoner
who has staked his existence on the goodwill
and clemency of a ruler.</p>

<p>“I will do what I can, Sylvia,” she said at
last. “I will speak to your father. I think
you ought to go.”</p>

<p>The girl’s face grew radiant. “Oh, you’re
an <em>angel</em>!” she cried. “What should I do
without you? Speak to him soon, Miss
Page!” she implored. “I can’t bear it any
longer. I really can’t. I get on so badly
with father now, and with mother too. I
can’t help it. I know I’ve got an awful
temper, but they irritate me so, and——”</p>

<p>Anne sat down beside her on the sofa. “I
will speak to your father,” she repeated. “But,
my dear, I know it’s a hard, perhaps almost an
impossible thing to ask you, but try to see your
parents’ point of view as well as your own.
They <em>have</em> one, you know,” she added, smiling.
“One that belongs to their age and the traditions
of their education. To them, though
you don’t believe it, their standpoint is as
important as yours to you.”</p>

<p>“But you think mine is right?” demanded
Sylvia, breathlessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span></p>

<p>Miss Page laughed. “For you, yes. But
I’m sorry for your people.”</p>

<p>“I believe you’re sorry for every one,” said
Sylvia, after a pause.</p>

<p>“There’s a tendency to get sorrier for most
people as one gets older, I admit. You must
bear with me, Sylvia.”</p>

<p>The girl flushed. “Now you’re laughing
at me,” she said.</p>

<p>“No. Only remembering how I felt at
your age, and being very sorry for you
too.”</p>

<p>“Ought I to see every one’s point of view
as you do?”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t. It’s not to be expected of
you. And after all, it’s right that you shouldn’t.
It’s the young who make history, and history
is made by seeing one thing at a time to the
exclusion of every other consideration. It’s
only in the autumn of life that one has time
to be sorry. But still my dear, you can be
kind even without comprehension. Remember
the immortal remark that our parents are
fellow-creatures after all.”</p>

<p>She looked at the girl whimsically, and
Sylvia laughed.</p>

<p>“How angry father would be to hear you
say that!” she cried. “But you wouldn’t say
it to him, of course,” she added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span></p>

<p>“You know it’s only nonsense; and there’s
such a thing as tact, my dear.”</p>

<p>“I know,” sighed Sylvia. “I haven’t got
any.”</p>

<p>“That’s another of the things that comes
with age.”</p>

<p>“All the nice things come with age, I
believe.”</p>

<p>“Well, age should have <em>some</em> compensations,”
returned Anne, gaily.</p>

<p>“You have <em>all</em> of them,” Sylvia declared.
“All the pretty things that generally belong to
girls, and all the interesting things that ought
to belong to women. It isn’t fair. You know
how to talk to every one. I should <em>love</em> to hear
what you say to father. It would be too
amusing! Mrs. Dakin came in this morning,
and said you were wonderful with the Frenchman
who dined here last night. And the way
you talk to Dr. Dakin is quite different from
the way you talk to father. And of course,
you’re quite different with me again. You
always remind me of that verse in the Bible
about being all things to all men!”</p>

<p>“You’re really a terrible young woman!”
was Miss Page’s reply. “Go and sing me
something. It’s the only way to stop you
from proving me a monster of duplicity.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” urged Sylvia, eagerly. “You

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
only speak to people as they can understand.
But the wonderful thing is, that you know by
instinct exactly what they <em>will</em> understand,
and exactly how to say it.”</p>

<p>“Go and sing,” repeated Anne.</p>

<p>Sylvia went laughing to the piano. “I
feel awfully happy. I must think of something
that suits.”</p>

<p>She considered a moment, and then broke
into a gay little love-song, with a charming
refrain.</p>

<p>Anne listened, and as she listened, her
determination grew. Sylvia was right. She
must go. Her voice was worth cultivating,
even at the price of parental displeasure.</p>

<p>“Thank you dear,” she said as the clear,
ringing notes ceased. “I feel as though a
nightingale with brains had been kind enough
to fly into my room.”</p>

<p>“What else would you like?” Sylvia
turned her head as she sat at the piano,
playing rippling notes with her left hand.
The cloud had left her face, and her parted
red lips were very sweet.</p>

<p>Anne hesitated a moment. “You read
music easily, don’t you? I wonder whether
you could sing me a little French song?”</p>

<p>She got up, and opening a cupboard in the
wall, began to turn over some papers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>

<p>“Here it is,” she said at last.</p>

<p>Sylvia left her place, and knelt beside her
friends chair, taking the music from her hand.</p>

<p>There were some words upon the cover,
but they were in French, and in a difficult
handwriting.</p>

<p>Anne opened the page rather quickly.
“You see it’s quite short and quite simple,”
she observed.</p>

<p>“Let me read the words first, and you must
correct my pronunciation.”</p>

<p>She began to say the lines a little falteringly,
but her quick ear soon found their lilt,
and she read them well.</p>

<p>“How pretty! They’re quite easy words.
I can understand them,” she said, going to the
piano again. “Who wrote them?”</p>

<p>Anne did not answer, and Sylvia, engrossed
in trying the accompaniment, forgot
her question.</p>

<p>“I see how it goes!” she exclaimed, playing
the first bars. Involuntarily, as she began the
first bar, Miss Page put out a quick hand as
though to stop her, but the girl sang on unconsciously,
and the hand dropped at her
side.</p>

<p>“It’s lovely!” Sylvia cried, playing the last
notes softly over again.</p>

<p>“Thank you, dear,” said Anne, gently.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
She had crossed the room, and was trying on
her garden hat.</p>

<p>With one hand she gathered up the folds
of her long gown.</p>

<p>“The sun is off the roses now, and I’m
going to give you some to take home to your
mother. Come out and help me pick them.”</p>

</div>


<p><span class='smcap'>Dr. Dakin’s</span> house stood in the village street.
It was a plain Georgian dwelling of a type
common to every English country town; a
type which admirably combines comfort with
a certain homely dignity.</p>

<p>It was covered with ivy, carefully trimmed
where the rows of square-paned windows broke
the front, and its long, narrow door was surmounted
by the conventional classic design of
skulls and garlands.</p>

<p>As Miss Page crossed the road towards the
post-office one morning late in September,
Mrs. Dakin tapped at the window of the
breakfast-room, and then ran to the door.</p>

<p>Anne smiled as she crossed the threshold.
“Why, Madge, what is it? You look radiant,
my dear!”</p>

<p>“I am. I mean I feel radiant. Come in.
Do come in. I want to tell you.”</p>

<p>Her voice shook with suppressed excitement,
as Anne followed her across the stone-flagged
hall to a room on the right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span></p>

<p>“I’m going to Paris for a long visit!” she
exclaimed, drawing up a chair for her friend
close to the window. “What do you think of
that?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you had friends in Paris.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes. Didn’t I ever tell you about
Helen Didier? She was one of my school-fellows
at the convent near Tours, where I
went for a year. She married a Frenchman.”</p>

<p>“And she lives in Paris?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I haven’t seen her for ages—scarcely
once since we both married. But I
took it into my head to write to her a week
or two ago, and just fancy! You’ll be awfully
interested. She knows Monsieur Fontenelle
quite well. Her husband is a friend of his.”</p>

<p>Anne looked up rather quickly. “Really?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Isn’t it strange? I happened to
mention him when I wrote to her, and she
knew all about him. She would, naturally, as
he’s such a great man; but it’s awfully exciting
that he should be a friend, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“What does Harry say?” asked Anne.</p>

<p>“Oh, he doesn’t mind. He says it will do
me good to have a change.”</p>

<p>“He will miss you horribly, my dear.”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. “He’s so
busy, you know. And when he’s at home,
he’s always buried in his books. Besides, he

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
knows I must have a change. My nerves
get worse and worse, and I’m always having
neuralgia. I sleep badly, too.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t look so brilliant, then,”
returned Anne, laughing. “You’ll be considered
a fraud.”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing but joy,” Madge declared.
“You know I’ve never been to Paris. And
just think of getting out of this hole for two
or three months, perhaps. I could scream with
excitement at the bare idea!”</p>

<p>“When do you go?”</p>

<p>“Next month. I shall be awfully interested
to meet Monsieur Fontenelle again,” she added.
“He’s so clever, isn’t he? I’m rather afraid
of him. I envy you for getting on with him so
well.”</p>

<p>Anne smiled.</p>

<p>“Why has he never been to see you
before?”</p>

<p>“He’s not often in England now, though he
travels a great deal, and is very cosmopolitan.”</p>

<p>“How on earth has he learnt to speak
English so perfectly?”</p>

<p>“He has English relations—Lady Farringchurch
is one of them. And as a young man
he studied over here with a friend. But in
any case he’s a wonderful linguist naturally.”</p>

<p>“What interesting people you must have

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
met!” exclaimed Madge, looking rather curiously
at her visitor. “I suppose you met him
during all those years you were travelling? I
often wonder how you stand this miserable little
dead-and-alive place. You must have had such
an exciting life.”</p>

<p>Anne did not reply for a moment.</p>

<p>“My dear,” she said at last quietly, “when
you come to my age, your garden, your books,
and your friends make a very pleasant haven
before you set sail.”</p>

<p>“And your memories, I suppose?” Madge
glanced again swiftly at her friend.</p>

<p>“And your memories—yes,” Anne repeated.</p>

<p>“I shall have none,” declared Madge,
restlessly. “None that count.”</p>

<p>Miss Page was silent. “Oh! I know you
think me an ungrateful wretch!” she broke
out, leaning back in her chair and tapping her
foot impatiently. “Harry’s very good and all
that. But I’m so <em>bored</em>. I’m bored from
morning till night. When I get up every
morning I think—‘Here’s another dull day,
what on earth shall I do with it?’ And sometimes
it doesn’t seem worth while to get up
and go on.”</p>

<p>Anne watched her as she stared moodily
into the narrow trim garden, discontent and

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
listlessness plainly expressed by her eyes and
drooping mouth.</p>

<p>She was a woman loved faithfully and with
infinite tenderness. If she had allowed them
expression, Anne’s reflection would have been
translated by a smile and a sigh, both of them
utterly unintelligible to the little woman at
her side. Both of them were therefore repressed.</p>

<p>“Well!” she said aloud. “I hope you’ll
have a very gay time. I’m very glad for you,
my dear. Go and be happy. Where does
your friend live?”</p>

<p>“Over by the Parc Monceau, wherever
that is. <em>Do</em> tell me what it’s like?” she
begged, all animation again.</p>

<p>Anne stayed a few minutes longer, talking
about Paris, and then rose to go.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dakin kissed her affectionately. “I
wish you were going with me. I shall miss
you horribly!” she declared.</p>

<p>She followed Anne to the door, and stood
a moment, waving and smiling as her friend
crossed the street.</p>

<p>All the bored discontent had vanished from
her face, and her husband, who at the moment
drove up in his car, thought she had never
looked prettier.</p>

<p>The reflection was accompanied by a curious

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
dull pain at his heart, a pain to which he was
well accustomed.</p>

<p>“I’ll drive you home,” he called to Miss
Page, stopping his car at the opposite pavement.</p>

<p>“So Madge is going to Paris?” she said,
as they swept off.</p>

<p>“Yes. I hope it will do her good,” he
returned shortly. “She complains of neuralgia.
Perhaps a change will set that right.
I hear the little Carfax girl is going to London
to study this autumn?” he added after a
moment. “She’s off her head with delight
about it. That’s <em>your</em> doing, of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suggested it to her father,” Anne
admitted.</p>

<p>He laughed. “We all know your suggestions.
When a witch ‘suggests,’ mere man
is instantly hypnotized. Poor old Carfax can
do nothing now, but put his hand in his pocket
and produce the necessary fees.”</p>

<p>Anne smiled. “Come in and look at my
hollyhocks,” she said, as they turned into the
drive. “They’re really worth seeing.”</p>

<p>The doctor followed her through the house
and across the lawn into one of the walled
gardens. “How gorgeous!” he exclaimed, as
she opened the gate.</p>

<p>The enclosure was a blaze of colour. Wine-red,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
white faintly flushed with pink, yellow
soft as a sunset sky, the flowers stood close
together in stately rows.</p>

<p>Behind them, on either side of the dividing
grass path, masses of phlox, white and rose and
crimson, continued the wave of colour till it
was arrested by the enclosing walls.</p>

<p>“Look at the butterflies,” said the doctor,
instinctively lowering his voice as though he
feared to disturb them.</p>

<p>They hovered in numbers above the silken
cups of the hollyhocks. On the sulphur-coloured
petals of one of them, a Purple
Emperor, motionless, extended his splendid
wings. Here and there, dazzling in fairy
armour of peacock-blue and sheen of silver,
darted a dragon-fly.</p>

<p>“The colour of the thing is intoxicating,”
murmured Dr. Dakin.</p>

<p>“It reminded me this morning of an elaborately
arranged ‘sensation’ scheme, planned
by that madman in <cite>À Rebours</cite>. Only of
course, he would have despised such a homely
natural flower as the hollyhock.”</p>

<p>The doctor smiled. “What a curious
anomaly you are here, my dear lady!” he
declared suddenly. “And yet that’s not true
either, because you also suit the place to
perfection. Huysmans, and a country practice,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
and Carfax—and you! It’s an amazing world.
I hope some intelligent Being doesn’t miss the
exquisite humour of many human juxtapositions,”
he added rather drily.</p>

<p>“I’m glad Sylvia’s going to study,” was
Miss Page’s somewhat irrelevant reply. “She
has a beautiful voice.”</p>

<p>“Quite remarkable,” he agreed. “She’ll
be a difficult young woman though, if that
face of hers means anything. I don’t know
that you haven’t thrown her to the lions.”</p>

<p>“My dear doctor, isn’t it better to meet
the lions, and take one’s chance, than to be
preyed upon by restlessness and discontent
till the whole of one’s character is worm-eaten?”
asked Anne, quietly.</p>

<p>The doctor stooped to examine the Purple
Emperor which still lay motionless, basking
in the sunshine.</p>

<p>When he raised his head Anne saw the
trouble in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re right,” he said. Then
abruptly, after a moment, “I wish I could give
Madge the life that would suit her!” he exclaimed,
jerking out the words awkwardly.</p>

<p>Miss Page waited a moment. “What do
you think <em>would</em> suit her?” she asked gently.</p>

<p>The doctor shrugged his shoulders. “She
wants to live in London, you know. She

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
wants a gayer life. But I should be no use in
town. I shouldn’t make a living even. I
haven’t the manner. It’s as much as I can do
to hold my own here.”</p>

<p>“Every one who knows you, ends by being
thankful to find a splendid friend as well as an
excellent doctor,” returned Anne.</p>

<p>The bitterness in his face softened. “If
all the world were like you,” he began with a
little laugh, and paused. “I’m glad they’re
not, though. There must only be one Miss
Page. But that’s it,” he went on, “I must
know people well—better than one could ever
know them in the rush of a London practice,
where the polished manner I don’t possess is
absolutely necessary.”</p>

<p>There was a silence, while they walked the
length of the grass path together.</p>

<p>“I ought never to have married Madge,”
he broke out at last, in a low voice. “She’s too
pretty, and too gay by nature, for a slow coach
like me. This village life is too dull for her.
She wants her dances, her theatres”—he
made a vague gesture—“all that sort of
thing. I can’t make her happy.”</p>

<p>There was a note of sad discouragement
in his voice which went to his listener’s heart.</p>

<p>“I think you could,” she said.</p>

<p>He turned his head sharply. “How?”

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
The involuntary hope died. He shook his
head. “She’s bored with me.”</p>

<p>“Partly I think, because she imagines you
are bored with her.”</p>

<p>He started. “<em>I?</em> Bored with Madge?”
He stopped, as though suddenly arrested, and
stood staring down at the grass. “I—I don’t
think you understand how much I—care for
Madge. She’s the only woman I ever wanted
to marry. I——”</p>

<p>His voice failed. Miss Page saw that his
face was working.</p>

<p>“I <em>do</em> know. Better than any one,
perhaps. But I don’t think you understand
her.”</p>

<p>He looked at her mutely, waiting for her
next words.</p>

<p>“You think of her as a butterfly, don’t
you? A woman with no brains, perhaps?
Oh! I know,” she interrupted, as he made
a gesture of protest. “I know that would
make no difference.” She smiled a little. “A
man doesn’t want the woman he loves to have
brains. But they are useful sometimes. In
her case they may be very useful. She would
like a life of gaiety, of course. She’s young
and pretty, and it’s only natural. But she
can’t have it. Very well then, if she were
nothing but a butterfly, her lot—and yours,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
would be hard. But Madge has a mind. Oh,
she’s ignorant, of course! She says so herself.
She never reads. She never thinks.
But that’s habit. No one has ever taken any
trouble with her. Did you notice how interested
she was the evening we were really
talking—the evening Monsieur Fontenelle
dined here? She was proud of you then.
She wished she could take part in the conversation.
Her mind is empty because she has
never troubled to fill it. But it’s a mind of
good quality. She has the power to be interested
in a thousand things. You could
open a new world to her, if you were careful—and
had a little tact. And we all know that
you possess that admirable quality!”</p>

<p>The flattery of her smile was not lost upon
the doctor.</p>

<p>Surprise, involuntary hope, gratitude, admiration,
all struggled in the look with which he
regarded her.</p>

<p>“You always say the right thing,”
he declared simply. “I didn’t know the
child——” He paused, but there was a look
of sudden tenderness in his eyes. “Well!
she’s going away now,” he began.</p>

<p>“And that’s such a good thing,” interrupted
Miss Page, eagerly. “She will hear
and see so much to interest her. She will

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
come back with new impressions. You will
have something to work on.”</p>

<p>They strolled out of the garden together,
and across the lawn without speaking.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” said the doctor, starting as
though from a deep reverie, as he found
himself opposite his car.</p>

<p>He pressed her hand warmly. “You have
made me much happier,” he added shyly.</p>

<p>“But don’t forget to tell her very often
that you love her, and that she’s the prettiest
thing in the world!” Miss Page admonished
him, with a laugh. “There are remarks which
never bore a woman, however many times
they are repeated. Those are two of them.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VI">VI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class='smcap'>The</span> midday post had come while Miss Page
and the doctor talked in the garden.</p>

<p>As she passed through the hall after the
motor-car had disappeared, Anne found her
letters lying upon the table.</p>

<p>She turned them over, and lighted with
satisfaction upon one with a foreign postmark.</p>

<p>Her correspondence with François Fontenelle—a
correspondence of fifteen years’
duration—had never ceased to be a pleasure
to her.</p>

<p>She picked up his letter, and went through
the inner hall into the garden, to the seat
under the beech tree.</p>

<p>Several things on the first page made her
laugh. François was evidently in a gay mood
when he wrote. He had more work with
portraits than he could get through. He
described his sitters with the light raillery
he managed so well, presenting them to his
reader with a felicity of phrase, a touch as
skilful and clever as she well knew the portraits
themselves must possess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span></p>

<p>It was better to be François Fontenelle’s
friend than his enemy, Miss Page reflected,
and smiled to remember the rash women who
now crowded to his studio, anxious to be
painted by the popular if distinguished artist.</p>

<p>She guessed how many of them winced
in secret at the result, and marvelled that
fashion, as well as religion, should exact its
willing martyrs.</p>

<p>“<cite>I hear</cite>,” he said towards the end of the
letter, “<cite>that I’m likely to renew my acquaintance
with your little friend, Mrs. Dakin. By a
strange chance, the wife of a friend of mine,
Louis Didier, knew her as a school-girl—went
to school with her, I think; and she has been
asked to visit them. Louis Didier is a good
fellow—an architect. No. You never met
him. I have known him myself only two
or three years. He belongs to the younger
generation. C’est un bon garçon, though his
work is mediocre enough. I don’t like his wife.
I suspect her of being what you in England
call a cat, though to me she is amiable enough.
I may possibly have struck terror into her feline
heart. When you are in Rome I want you
to go again to the Farnesina Palace, and look
at the Correggio. You know the one I mean?</cite>”
The letter ended with talk about pictures.</p>

<p>Anne read it to the last word, and then

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
sat with it still unfolded in her lap. Her eyes
were fixed on the drooping branches of the
beech under which she sat.</p>

<p>Its leaves were already yellow, and it rose
like a fountain of gold towards the quiet
September sky. All round the eaves of the
house the swallows were skimming and crying,
in the unrest of an imminent parting, and the
hazy sunshine wrapped the garden in a dream
of peace.</p>

<p>Anne too, sat dreaming. Ever since the
visit of her friend, earlier in the summer, her
thoughts had developed a tendency to wander
back over the years before their meeting.</p>

<p>To-day it was of her first five years at
Fairholme Court that she was thinking.</p>

<p>She remembered driving up to the house
that was now her home.</p>

<p>She remembered walking through the hall
into the drawing-room, distressfully conscious,
even through her shyness, of the desecrated
stateliness of a dwelling meant for beauty.</p>

<p>True, she would not in those days have
known with what to replace the gaudy Axminster
carpet in the hall, nor the arsenic
green curtains at the drawing-room windows.
But little as she had seen, little as she
then knew of material loveliness, the right
instinct she possessed for form and colour was

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
outraged at every turn by the indications at
once trivial and ponderous of Mid-Victorian
taste.</p>

<p>As she entered the drawing-room, Mrs.
Burbage rose from the sofa on which she had
been lying, a woollen rug of rainbow hues
thrown across her feet.</p>

<p>She was a little old woman with grey,
corkscrew curls hanging in bunches over her
ears, keen eyes, and a mouth which combined
shrewdness and suspicion.</p>

<p>She looked Anne up and down with a
penetrating glance.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think you would have grown
so tall,” she remarked. “You were a little
creature when I last saw you. Ring for tea,
my dear, and then I dare say you would like
to go to your room. Parker will show you.
Make yourself at home, and amuse yourself
in your own way, if you can find anything
to do in this dull place. I don’t want you
to think you need trouble about running after
me, unless I ask for you. I hate fuss. There
will be time enough for that when I get worse.”</p>

<p>The words struck the keynote of the future
relationship between the two women.</p>

<p>Even at that time Anne’s benefactress was
a semi-invalid who did not rise till noon, and
usually spent the rest of the day on the sofa,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
knitting interminably. Her illness, not at first
severe, made any but the slightest attention
unnecessary. She was a woman a little
eccentric, often difficult in temper, but never
exacting in trifles.</p>

<p>Her great abhorrence was what she called
“fuss” of any sort, and as she frequently
preferred to be alone, she left Anne for the
most part free.</p>

<p>Her duties gradually became those of
general supervision of the household, which
composed as it was of elderly well-trained
servants, proved no arduous task.</p>

<p>Few callers came to the house. There
was never anything in the nature of entertainment
at Fairholme Court. The days went
on. Monotonously, peacefully, spring glided
into summer, summer to autumn; the winters
came and went.</p>

<p>A good understanding, a quiet comradeship
was gradually established between the old
woman and her companion, who moved so
gently, whose voice was so soothing, who was
always at hand when she happened to be
wanted—never in the way when her presence
was not required.</p>

<p>Anne practically led her own isolated life.
Too shy to make any advances, the people of
her own grade in the village, from the outset,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
ignored the companion of a woman who had
never been popular. She was just a quiet,
harmless creature, lady-like certainly, but
very dull, whom they occasionally pitied for
being shut up with “that disagreeable Mrs.
Burbage.”</p>

<p>Anne found the bedroom she had loved as
a child, now her own, almost unchanged. The
rosebuds on the wall were faded certainly, but
the dimity valance at the window, the white
curtains to the bed were fresh and spotless,
and the “spindly” furniture remained. The
white roses had grown much taller. They
clambered round the window now, and far
above her head, looked down at her as she
opened it in the morning.</p>

<p>The library was also unaltered, and in this
room, and in the garden, Anne found all the
joy of her life.</p>

<p>She was permitted to do what she liked
with the garden, and, under the direction of
the old gardener, who rejoiced to find some
one who loved the work, and, delighted in its
results, Anne planned and planted and laid
the foundation for the beauty that now surrounded
her. The hours in the open air
restored her health. Insensibly, she grew
strong and straight. Her always graceful
figure developed, and though it was marred

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
by the ill-cut gowns of the village dressmaker,
she carried it superbly.</p>

<p>Through the long winter days, the library
was her solace and delight. At first, imperfectly
educated as she was, unused to
reading, owing to lack of time and lack
of opportunity, she was bewildered by the
numberless books through which she was free
to range.</p>

<p>But gradually she found her way; made a
path for herself, and followed it to find it leading
her to distant prospects. Mr. Burbage, a
gentle and scholarly recluse with a catholic
taste in literature, had left a fine and widely
representative library behind him, containing
not only the masterpieces of French as well as
English prose and poetry, but many curious
and rare volumes dealing with the less frequented
roads of mental travel.</p>

<p>Anne found history, biography, philosophy,
in sufficient quantities to last her for a lifetime.</p>

<p>She found curious memoirs of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, as well as
books on magic, on alchemy, on all the strange
and recondite studies which at various periods
have exercised human thought. French literature
was well represented, and impelled by
interest and curiosity, Anne began to recall

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
the little of the language she had learnt with
her governess as a child. In this endeavour
she unexpectedly found a ready teacher in
Mrs. Burbage, who, educated in a French
convent up to the time of her marriage, spoke
the language fluently, and liked to speak it.
Naturally gifted as a linguist, Anne learnt
quickly, and often from choice, as time went
on, the two women spoke French together,
rather than English.</p>

<p>But it was to the English poets that Anne
most often returned. Poetry suited her nature.
It was the form of art which to her, most fully
expressed the heights and depths, the beauty
and the terror, the haunting melancholy, the
fear, the inexpressible longings, the regrets, the
sadness, the innocent delights of life, which, in
all its complexity, she had begun to recognize
through the world of books.</p>

<p>In life, men went down to the sea in ships,
and did business in great waters. In life, there
had been beautiful cities, in which a many-coloured
crowd of citizens and soldiers, of
artists and thinkers, had jostled and fought,
and painted their thoughts in churches, and on
palace walls; built them into soaring towers,
and mighty cathedrals; woven them into immortal
books, and lived them in schemes for
the regeneration of the world. In life, as

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
Anne had come to know it through her
reading, there had been, and still were, fierce
passions of love and hate, swaying men and
women as the trees of a forest are swayed by
a rushing wind. Passions which had given
birth to the great stories of the world—the
stories of Helen of Troy, of Abelard and
Heloise, of Launcelot and Guinevere, of
Romeo and Juliet. In life, running like a
dark mysterious stream, among the simpler
sensations, the more elemental passions of
humanity, there had been strange terrors,
haunting curiosities, insatiable longings for the
unattainable, the unknowable, the unrealized—the
desire of the moth for the star.</p>

<p>In life too, there had always existed the
fresh unspoiled delight in Nature’s loveliness;
in the charming natural embroidery of earth’s
garment. Delight in the simple things out
of which, as her favourite Herrick told her,
he rejoiced to make his songs.</p>

<p>In poetry, as in a mirror, Anne found the
result of all her reading reflected and transfigured.</p>

<p>It summed up for her all that she had
learnt from other books, of love and life, and
hope of immortality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span></p>

<p>She began with Chaucer, and found him
sweet and fresh and hardy as the hawthorn
blossom with which he powders his English
meadows. She found in him all the simple
and tender emotions which have existed in
the heart of man since he became human.
The love of Custance for her child delighted
her.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The gentle, natural words, written five
hundred years ago, went to her heart. She
loved the gaiety, the bustle, the gossip, the
sense of colour and vitality in that long procession
which wound from the Tabard Inn,
along the white roads full of sunshine, which
led to Canterbury.</p>

<p>She read the ballads which like vivid
lightning flashes illumine the darkness of the
Middle Ages, and show the mainsprings of
human action to be ever the old mainsprings
of love and hate.</p>

<p>She came to the Elizabethan poets—to
the period when England had become “a
nest of singing birds.” She found Spenser’s
glorious love-song, and the wonderful cry in

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
which Marlowe’s Faust links one great love-story
to another.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She learnt to know so well that they
haunted her thoughts like music, the sonnets
of Shakespeare, and the lyrics of all the
“singing birds,” Lodge and Peele and Nash,
Ben Jonson and Campion, who, a musician
in every sense of the word, framed his “Ayres
for one voyce with the Lute or Violl,” so
as “to couple words and notes lovingly
together.” She came to Milton, and the
lighter poets of the Restoration, of whom
her love was given chiefly to Herrick. The
poets of comparatively modern times followed,
and led her in due time to Keats and
Shelley, who revealed to her the modern
note of unrest, and the troubling effect on
the human spirit, of beauty, whether revealed
as to Keats in the material world, or as
to Shelley in the intangible world of ideas.
With these two poets, the library, formed in
her old friend’s youth, paused abruptly in its
representations of English poetry.</p>

<p>Anne found no volume of Browning, nor
of Tennyson, on the shelves.</p>

<p>In her friend’s day they were young,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
untried men, as in a still greater degree, were
Swinburne, Morris, and Meredith.</p>

<p>But without them, Anne, like Keats, had
travelled in the realms of gold, and the new
planet that swam into her ken was the very
world in which for thirty years she had lived
blind and a prisoner, ignorant of its beauty,
deaf to its calling voices.</p>

<p>It was of her five years of solitary reading
that Anne was thinking as she sat in the
September sunshine with François’s letter open
on her lap.</p>

<p>She had read, she had thought. Imaginatively,
she had entered into the life of the
great world outside her country home.</p>

<p>But of actual individual experience of one
personal heart-beat, known to thousands of
men and women past and present, she was as
ignorant at thirty-five as she had been all
through her quiet existence.</p>

<p>Like the Lady of Shalott, she sat weaving
her tapestry of dreams before a magic mirror
in which the pageant of the world was nothing
but a reflection; a shadow-dance of figures,
loving, hating, struggling; pursuing brave
adventures, triumphing or defeated, hopeful
or despairing.</p>

<p>Miss Page folded her letter, and replaced
it slowly in its envelope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span></p>

<p>It was the day for her class of village
children, whom she taught to sew, and to
whom, while they wrestled with long seams,
she read fairy tales.</p>

<p>There was tea in the garden afterwards,
and she had forgotten to tell Burks to put
out the strawberry jam.</p>

<p>She rose, and went into the house to
repair the omission.</p>

<p>“<span class='smcap'>We</span> shall have a very dull winter,” complained
Mrs. Carfax, “with so many of you
away. Sylvia and Mrs. Dakin have gone
already, and now you are going to desert us.
We shall feel quite lost.”</p>

<p>It was a damp afternoon in mid-October,
and the wood-fire in Miss Page’s drawing-room
glowed cheerfully.</p>

<p>The tea-table was drawn up near its blaze,
and Mrs. Carfax leant back comfortably in the
corner of the sofa, sipping her tea and eating
hot cakes appreciatively.</p>

<p>“So you’re going to Rome?” she continued.
“We hoped as you didn’t go away last year
you had become reconciled to an English
winter.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to go,” confessed Anne.
“I was very happy here last year. But somehow
this autumn I have begun to long for
more sunshine. I know we’ve had a lovely
summer, and I ought to be content, but the
rain of the last fortnight has decided me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span></p>

<p>She glanced with a little shiver towards the
drenched garden. The rain had been too
persistent to make much sweeping of leaves
practicable, and the grass was strewn with
them, yellow, battered and rotting.</p>

<p>“Tell me about Sylvia!” she inquired.
“I heard from her the other day, but I dare say
you have later news. She seems very happy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she writes in excellent spirits, as of
course she would, now she’s got her own
way.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carfax’s expression was one of rather
irritable displeasure, and Anne’s inward reflections
turned on that deplorable yet possibly
comprehensible antagonism which so frequently
exists between children and parents; the tie of
blood so binding, yet so provocative of mutual
adverse criticism, involuntary irritation and
impatience.</p>

<p>“Do you like the boarding-house?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh yes. Very nice. Her father and I
took her there last week, you know. I couldn’t
be easy till I’d seen what sort of place she was
in. And men are no good at that sort of
thing.” She helped herself to another tea-cake.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” she repeated, “it’s a very comfortable
house; on the Embankment, I think

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
you call it. At any rate, it’s quite close to the
school where she takes her lessons. Sylvia
shares a sitting-room with Susie Villiers, one
of her school-fellows who is studying at the
Slade, is it? I always forget the names of
these places. It’s a house built on purpose for
students, I understand. <em>Most</em> comfortable.
Hot and cold water on every floor, and bathrooms,
and a beautiful dining-room. To my
mind it’s all <em>too</em> luxurious. Everything is done
nowadays, it seems to me, to tempt young
people from their homes.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carfax gave an exasperated sigh.</p>

<p>“But Sylvia has a great gift, dear Mrs.
Carfax,” pleaded Anne. “It isn’t as though
she leaves home to do nothing.”</p>

<p>“That’s what her father says now. He
never used to. He always upheld me in maintaining
that the place of the eldest daughter is
at home. I don’t know what you could have
said to change him so, Miss Page, but ever
since he talked to you about Sylvia, his cry is
that it’s sinful not to use the gifts with which
God has endowed us. Men are so inconsistent;
and if they’re clergymen they always seem able
to quote some text to annoy you. I don’t mean
to be profane, but sometimes I have found the
Bible most trying.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carfax sighed again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span></p>

<p>“She has a lovely voice. You will be
proud of her one day,” declared Miss Page,
with her disarming smile.</p>

<p>“But what is she going to do with it? I
would never consent to a child of mine singing
in public, with her name in newspapers, and
on placards and all that! It would break my
heart.”</p>

<p>“Still you needn’t think of the future yet,
need you? She has years of training before
her.”</p>

<p>“But if she’s not going to do anything
with it, what a waste of money!” exclaimed
Mrs. Carfax, tragically. “I think it’s much
better for girls not to have gifts,” she added.</p>

<p>Miss Page was rather disposed to consider
that her guest had uttered a great truth.</p>

<p>Her reply however, was non-committal.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” she said. “But if they <em>do</em>
possess them don’t you agree with Mr. Carfax
that it’s right to cultivate them? A gift of
any sort is such a worrying thing,” she added
persuasively. “And if it’s allowed to rust, it
chiefly worries its possessor. Now that she’s
doing what she was born to do, Sylvia will
be contented. I <em>don’t</em> think it’s just because
she’s getting her own way that she’s happy.
It’s deeper than that. She’s satisfied because
she’s fulfilling a need of her nature for which

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
she’s no more responsible than she is for the
colour of her very pretty eyes.”</p>

<p>Anne’s voice was so gentle, her smile
so irresistible, that Mrs. Carfax was visibly
softened.</p>

<p>“At any rate I’m glad it’s not art she’s
got a taste for,” she conceded.</p>

<p>To Mrs. Carfax, painting, to the exclusion
of all the other activities of the Muses, was
art, as Miss Page understood.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t like her to paint?”</p>

<p>“Oh landscapes and flowers, and that sort
of thing is all right. A very nice amusement.
I’ve got lots of water-colour sketches I did
as a girl, and hand-painted screens, and sofa
cushions too. But nowadays art is such a
shocking thing, isn’t it? I hear that Susie
Villiers draws from the nude, as they call it.
To me, it’s a perfectly disgusting idea. And
they draw <em>men</em>, as well as women. Imagine
a young girl having the boldness to draw a
man without his clothes!”</p>

<p>“Do have some of this toast before it gets
cold,” urged Anne. “Oh! while I think of
it I wish you would tell me how to make that
delicious shortbread I tasted the last time I
came to you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carfax, adroitly switched off the topic
of art as she understood it, was on firm ground

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
now that culinary operations held the conversational
field.</p>

<p>She gave minute directions to which her
friend listened with flattering attention.</p>

<p>“I must write that down before I forget
it,” said Anne, opening a bureau to take from
it her book of recipes.</p>

<p>“How beautifully orderly you are!” exclaimed
her guest, glancing with admiration
at the packets of papers tied with ribbon, the
piles of little books which filled the pigeonholes.
“What a pity you never married.
You would have made <em>such</em> a good wife. The
wives of to-day are shocking housekeepers.
Look at that flighty little Mrs. Dakin! The
doctor, poor man, must suffer a good deal.
I doubt whether he ever gets a decent meal.
Don’t you think it’s very extraordinary of him
to let her go away for such a long visit as she
proposes to make? I think that kind of thing
is a mistake, you know.”</p>

<p>Launched upon the stream of gossip for
which she possessed a considerable weakness,
Mrs. Carfax shook her head portentously.</p>

<p>“He thinks it will be good for her health.
She’s not very strong, is she? And this place
doesn’t suit her in the winter.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t think there’s much the matter
with her health,” answered Mrs. Carfax with

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
a touch of scorn. “She hasn’t anything else
to think of. She hasn’t enough to do, that’s
what’s the matter with her. One or two
children would soon make her forget her
ailments. Poor Dr. Dakin! I <em>don’t</em> think
she’s very nice to him, do you? I often
pity him.”</p>

<p>“But I’m quite sure they’re devoted to one
another,” began Miss Page, hailing with relief
the entrance of the Vicar, who had called to
fetch his wife, and to bid their hostess farewell.</p>

<p>“Well, dear lady!” he exclaimed in his
hearty voice. “So you’re off to the land of
perpetual sunshine to-morrow. Lucky woman!
And Rome too, a city which I have always
had a great desire to visit. Most interesting.
Most interesting. But you leave us desolate.”</p>

<p>“How kind of you to come and say good-bye!
My farewells this week have made me
quite sad,” declared Anne. “I hate last days.”</p>

<p>“We shall all miss you terribly. You leave
a heart-broken community behind you,” said
the Vicar. “Poor Dakin is already bemoaning
his fate, bereft of his wife and of you. It’s a
good thing Sylvia isn’t here, or we should
have had nothing but lamentations till the
spring.”</p>

<p>“You all spoil me,” Anne said in a moved
voice. “We have been talking about Sylvia,”

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
she went on rather hurriedly. “I’m so glad
she’s happy.”</p>

<p>“Best thing for her. Quite the right
thing!” declared the Vicar emphatically. “I’m
always telling my wife that gifts are ours as a
sacred trust. Moreover, when the girl comes
back for the holidays and so on, she will
appreciate her home, and we shall all get on
much better in consequence. Girls as well
as boys must find their own paths, and make
their own lives. To thwart them only leads
to unnecessary friction, and is after all unjust.
Every girl should have her chance.”</p>

<p>If Miss Page smiled in secret to find the
ideas she had implanted in the Vicar’s mind
so well assimilated that they re-appeared in
the form of original conviction, no trace of
her amusement was visible.</p>

<p>“I’m sure Mrs. Carfax will find that you’re
right,” was her remark, as she smiled at the
lady in question.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carfax kissed her affectionately.
“Good-bye. I’m sure we’re preventing you
from looking after your packing,” she said.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” echoed her husband, enclosing
Anne’s frail hand in his vigorous clasp. “Don’t
let Sylvia bother you with too many letters.
I am convinced that I’ve done the right thing
by the child in sticking to my own ideas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span></p>

<p>He smiled the manly smile of self-confidence
and wisdom denied to women, and Miss Page,
following her visitors to the hall-door, waved
to them as they went down the drive together.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The amusement that she need no longer
repress, was in her eyes, as she went upstairs
to her room; the gentle tolerant amusement
of a woman old enough to look at life with
kindly sympathy for its absurdities, and that
charity without which the spectacle has a
tendency to move to a mirth as bitter and
more cruel than anger.</p>

<p>She found Burks on her knees before a
trunk, still engaged in packing.</p>

<p>“That will do, Burks. I’ll finish it myself,”
she said. “You go down and get your
tea.”</p>

<p>After the maid had left, Anne opened the
door which led from her bedroom into her
sitting-room, and examined the shelves with
the idea of choosing one or two favourite books
to take with her on her journey.</p>

<p>The books in this room were chiefly modern,
supplementing the library downstairs.</p>

<p>She chose one or two French novels, and a
little volume of Herrick, which had found its
way to the shelves mostly devoted to French
literature. Then she returned to the bedroom,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
which was already bright with lamp and firelight.</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, then went to the
bureau, from which several months before she
had taken her old journal.</p>

<p>This time she sought for, and found another
book. After adjusting the spring, and locking
the writing part of the piece of furniture, she
thrust this volume, without looking at it, deep
into her nearly filled trunk.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIII">VIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class='smcap'>Anne</span> always returned with pleasure to Rome,
a city which she knew well, and to which she
was bound by many memories. She settled
down happily with her maid in the little hotel
in the heart of the city, at which she frequently
stayed.</p>

<p>It had been chosen chiefly on account of
the garden which her rooms overlooked—one
of those charming Roman gardens, full of
orange-trees in tubs, of oleanders, and of
clambering vines.</p>

<p>A fountain splashed in the midst, and the
sound of its falling water was music in her
ears.</p>

<p>The deep blue sky, the dazzling sunshine
never ceased to fill her with a sense of buoyancy
and youth, and all her wanderings to
distant churches, to ruined temples; amongst
pictures, and statues, were a delight.</p>

<p>One morning, when she had tired herself
by a long ramble through the halls and corridors
of the Vatican, she returned with the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
determination to do nothing for the rest of the
day, but read and be lazy.</p>

<p>She went to her room after lunch, her mind
filled with the beauty of the Borgia rooms in
which she had just lingered.</p>

<p>The ribbed ceilings, rich with the gorgeous
colour of the emblems and coats-of-arms of
the princely house, the marble pavements, the
lofty windows, formed the empty frame into
which her fancy painted pictures of the scenes
those rooms had beheld. She heard the rustle
of dresses stiff with gold and gems; she caught
the backward glance of many a face; the face
of Isabella d’Este, of Beatrice, of Lucrezia,
framed in the golden hair she washed so frequently,
and tended with such care.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Browning’s words had come to Anne’s
mind as she stood for a moment alone in one
of the ante-chambers, and glanced about her
as though expecting it to be full of ghosts.</p>

<p>She wondered how many of these golden-haired
women had loved the painted walls
upon which her eyes now rested. Those
wonderful frescoes of Pinturicchio with their
background of valley and mountain, and their
flower-starred meadows; their animals and

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
birds, their fantastic towers, their dainty
figures, fanciful and charming as a fairy tale.</p>

<p>She hoped they had loved them, and praised
the painter with their sweetest smiles.</p>

<p>Outside in the garden, the fountain splashed
in the sunshine, and suddenly its melody was
the melody of her own fountain in her own
English garden at home.</p>

<p>She thought of it lovingly, and planned a
new hedge of briar-roses in the sunny corner
where the dovecote stood.</p>

<p>Gradually the memory of the garden filled
her mind, and blotted out the stately visions of
palaces and princes.</p>

<p>It grew peopled with well-known figures,
with men who twenty years ago had walked
with her across its green lawn, had sat with
her under its trees, laughing, talking, reading,
sometimes, but rarely silent.</p>

<p>Presently she rose, and took from a locked
drawer the book she had brought from home,
and till this moment, forgotten.</p>

<p>Sitting in the sunshine, with the splash of the
fountain sounding in her ears, Anne opened it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>March 3.</i> Hugh came home last November
to marry Alice,” were the first words that
met her eyes.</p>

<p>“They have taken a little furnished cottage

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
by the sea, at St. Margaret’s Bay near Dover,
and they want me to stay with them before
they sail for New Zealand. Mrs. Burbage says
of course I must go, and I start to-morrow
to be with them for a fortnight. I long to
see Hugh again, but I’m shy at the thought
of meeting his wife. I have never seen her.”</p>
</div>

<p>Except for the mention of her return to
Fairholme Court, there was nothing written in
the book from that date, till May of the same
year, and the painful colour crept into Anne’s
face as she noticed this.</p>

<p>There was no need for written record.
Clearly, as though she had recently lived
through the experience, she remembered that
fortnight’s visit.</p>

<p>She remembered getting out of the train at
the wayside station, the nearest station touched
by the railroad, for St. Margaret’s Bay. Her
heart was beating rather fast. It was eighteen
years since she had seen Hugh. Should she
recognize him? He would not know her.
When he last came home she was a girl of
seventeen. The thought of her present age
struck her with a shock of dismay.</p>

<p>There were only two people on the platform.
A big burly man, tall and bearded, and
beside him a girl in a white serge dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span></p>

<p>Hugh and his wife!</p>

<p>“I am Anne,” she stammered, going up to
them.</p>

<p>Hugh put his arms round her with his old
impulsive roughness, and then held her away
from him.</p>

<p>“Why, you’ve grown, Anne!” he cried
gaily. “You were such a little thing! So
slight, I mean. Darling, this is Anne. Isn’t
she a <ins title='original: demned'>damned</ins> fine woman?”</p>

<p>His old laugh rang out boyishly, as Anne
turned shyly to his wife.</p>

<p>She was very small, very daintily made,
very prettily dressed. Her face, despite her
twenty-five years, was still babyish with its
large blue eyes and rings of soft hair round a
childish forehead. She took her sister-in-law’s
hand and smiled, but even then, Anne did
not miss the quick glance that scrutinized her
quizzically from head to foot.</p>

<p>From that moment, she knew that for Alice
she was merely a dowdily dressed woman; an
old maid, some one to be treated with patronizing
kindliness.</p>

<p>They drove from the station to the
cottage, which was almost upon the seashore.</p>

<p>“Hugh loves the sea. He can’t be happy
away from it, can you, darling?” Alice asked,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
slipping her hand into his, as they entered
the little parlour where tea was spread.</p>

<p>“Now Anne, tell us all about it!” exclaimed
Hugh as they sat down. “Bless my
soul, it’s seventeen or eighteen years since I
saw you. What have you been doing all this
time?”</p>

<p>A sudden paralyzing blankness fell upon
Anne’s mind.</p>

<p>What had she been doing? For thirteen
years after her brother’s last departure, she
had lived in the little house in Tufton Street,
managing the house work, anxiously counting
her weekly allowance for fear that with all her
pains, both ends could not be made to meet.
She had nursed a hopeless invalid, and tried to
bear his exacting temper with patience. For
the last five of the eighteen years she had read
books, and worked in the garden. There was
nothing to tell them.</p>

<p>Instinctively she felt that to these people
who belonged to practical life, who lived and
loved, who were in the mainstream of human
activity, her world of books meant nothing.</p>

<p>The colour rushed to her cheeks, and left
them white.</p>

<p>“I—I have done nothing at all,” she
stammered. “You know I have been living
with Mrs. Burbage for five years? She’s

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
very kind. But she’s almost an invalid,
so we’re—we’re very quiet. Tell me about
yourself, Hugh. Things are always happening
to you.”</p>

<p>“Well, <em>this</em> has happened to me,” he
returned with a laugh, slipping his arm round
his wife’s shoulder. “The best thing that
ever happened in my life.”</p>

<p>Alice drew close to him with a little
nestling movement, and Anne suddenly felt
a sickening pain at her heart.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so silly, Hugh! Any one
would think we were lovers,” she declared,
turning to her sister-in-law. “And we’ve
been married ages. Nearly four months.”</p>

<p>“Well, aren’t we lovers?” demanded
Hugh, shaking her. “Answer me at once.
Aren’t we?”</p>

<p>She got up laughing, and kissed the top
of his head.</p>

<p>“Of course we are. But don’t be silly!”
she commanded. She blushed, but her eyes
were bright with happiness.</p>

<p>“Oh never mind Anne!” said Hugh.
“She’s one of the family. She doesn’t count.”</p>

<p>The light, kindly meant words caused
Anne another strange pang. She didn’t
count. Of course she didn’t count. Why
should she?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span></p>

<p>“How lovely the sea is!” she exclaimed
hastily. “I can’t look at it enough. You
know I’ve only seen it once before.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! How’s that?” asked Hugh,
with the easy forgetfulness of a man who does
not realize the straitened life in which he
never had a part.</p>

<p>“I never went away,” said Anne, simply.
“There was no money. Once when I was
a child, Miss Atkins took me for a day to
Broadstairs. You remember Miss Atkins?”</p>

<p>“Old Thomas? She was Anne’s governess,
and exactly like a tortoise-shell cat,” he
explained turning to his wife. “Yes, what’s
become of her?”</p>

<p>“Dead,” said Anne. “She died ten years
ago.”</p>

<p>“Poor old thing!” returned Hugh perfunctorily.
“Darling, won’t you show Anne
her room, and then we can go for a walk
before supper. Isn’t it warm here!” he
exclaimed, leaning from the open window.
“It’s so sheltered you see with the cliffs
at the back. Make haste, Anne. We’ll take
you on to the downs, and show you the sea
to your heart’s content.”</p>

<p>At supper the talk was all about Hugh.
His past adventures, his future prospects. He
had worked hard, and was now partner of the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
promising sheep farm in New Zealand, to
which next month he proposed to return with
his wife.</p>

<p>“I tell Alice it won’t be a very gay existence
for her. She doesn’t look much like a
farmers wife, does she?” He threw her an
admiring glance. “But she declares she won’t
mind.”</p>

<p>“<em>You’ll</em> be there,” was Alice’s only comment.</p>

<p>“Oh yes! And there are neighbours too.
Very jolly people. And Bob Holmes, that’s
my partner, you know, Anne, is an awfully
decent fellow. You’ll like his wife, Alice.
She’s such a cheery little woman. Oh! it’s
not so bad. And the climate’s splendid.
Lord! how one misses the sun in this damp
misty old country!”</p>

<p>“It will be lovely. I’m longing to go,”
Alice exclaimed.</p>

<p>“You see she’s only got an uncle and
aunt to leave,” explained Hugh, turning to his
sister. “She’s a very lonely little person.”</p>

<p>“Not now,” said Alice, her voice full of
content.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Before she had been with them two days,
Anne had found herself filled with a passionate
longing to return to her quiet home. To get

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
back to the shelter in which she was not
reminded twenty times an hour that she
“didn’t count.”</p>

<p>She was amazed at the violence of her
own emotions.</p>

<p>Every glance exchanged by the married
lovers, every word of love, every caress,
stabbed her afresh.</p>

<p>She had never before known what it was
to feel acutely, and the suffering bewildered
her. She was afraid of it. She wanted
desperately to escape from herself, this new
self which seemed all torn and bleeding.</p>

<p>There was a hunted look in her eyes like
that of a starving and desperate animal. She
shuddered at them sometimes when they met
her suddenly in the glass. One evening,
unable to bear the sight of their endearments,
she had gone early to her room, pleading
a headache. She groped her way to the
window, in the dark, and kneeling down
beside it, looked out upon the sea.</p>

<p>Every few minutes, a flash from the lighthouse
on the cliffs momentarily illumined the
still water. Far out, lights moved on the prow
of passing ships. She could hear the wash and
murmur of the waves, as they broke lazily on
the pebbly shore.</p>

<p>For a long time she knelt there immovable,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
the sound of the sea lulling her into a sort of
painless trance, till the hum of voices below
gradually filtered to her senses. The evening
was so warm that Hugh and his wife were
sitting in the garden. At first, numbed and
half conscious in mind, she scarcely heeded the
murmur of talk, but finally a sentence in a
man’s voice reached her consciousness.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, darling! She’s not at all bad
looking. Well dressed, she’d be a fine figure
of a woman.”</p>

<p>“Why is she so dowdy then?”</p>

<p>“She lives in the country, you see. I
suppose there’s no one to dress for. And
after all what does it matter?”</p>

<p>There was a little laugh. “No. She’s too
old now. She’ll never marry.”</p>

<p>Again there was an incoherent murmur.
“Yes I know, darling, it’s boring for you.
But she’s had a dreary life, poor girl. I want
you to be nice to her.”</p>

<p>“I <em>am</em> nice,” the answer came in a hurt
voice, and was followed immediately by a
rustle.</p>

<p>“I know you are. You’re a darling.
You’re the sweetest thing on this earth!”</p>

<p>There was a sound of a kiss, and Anne
drew back from the window with a quick
movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span></p>

<p>“Hush!” The exclamation came swiftly
from Hugh.</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s all right. Her light’s out. She’s
asleep.”</p>

<p>Anne closed the window noiselessly to shut
out the voices to which she had listened without
her will, scarcely conscious of how they
had reached her. She threw herself on her
bed in the dark. After all, as Hugh said, it
didn’t matter. But she cried all night as though
it did.</p>

<p>In the journal which Miss Page held open
on her knee, she saw the date of her return
recorded.</p>

<p>“<cite>Came back to Fairholme Court, March
17th.</cite>”</p>

<p>She remembered her old friend’s greeting,
as she went to find her in the morning-room,
where she was lying on the sofa.</p>

<p>“Why, Anne! Sea air doesn’t suit you.
You’ve got thin, my dear. You look quite
ill. You mustn’t go away again.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said quietly. “I will never go
away again.”</p>

<p>She remembered going into the library
before she took off her walking things, looking
round at the walls lined with books, and wondering
why they had ever meant anything to
her at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span></p>

<p>“Books are no good,” she said to herself,
as she went upstairs.</p>

<p>“This also is vanity,” was what the words
implied.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Miss Page looked out with a sort of surprise
upon the garden steeped in sunshine.
The fountain was still splashing gaily into its
marble basin. In the blue overhead, two
pigeons flashed and wheeled. She had been
living over again the life of many years ago,
with such intensity of vision and of feeling,
that her present surroundings had the unreality
of a dream.</p>

<p>After a few moments, she turned the next
page, knowing well what she should find, yet
curious to see the words in her own handwriting
of twenty years ago.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<cite>May 15th.—We have had visitors to-day
for the first time almost, since I have lived
here. They were all men, too, and Frenchmen.
The parents of one of them, Monsieur René
Dampierre, knew Mrs. Burbage long ago, and
he called and brought three friends with him.</cite>”</p>
</div>

<p>As Anne slowly turned the pages, isolated
paragraphs met her eye.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<cite>I felt horribly shy at first, but only for
a little while. They were all so nice. I suppose

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
Frenchmen have easier manners than Englishmen,
though I have had no experience of either.</cite>”</p>

<p>“<cite>Monsieur Fontenelle is very amusing and
clever. I like his face, though he looks sarcastic,
and I’m sure he can say bitter things. But he
never says them to me.</cite>”</p>

<p>“<cite>Mrs. Burbage wanted me to describe
Monsieur Dampierre in whom she is chiefly
interested, because she knew him when he was
a child. I found it very difficult. When I had
said that he was tall, and broad-shouldered,
and very fair and handsome, it seemed as though
I had said nothing. It’s his smile and his
changing face which make up his personality—a
very charming one.</cite>”</p>
</div>

<p>All through that summer there were short
entries concerning the little colony of Frenchmen
that had settled in the village.</p>

<p>Anne glanced at them with a smile. It
was a very sweet smile, scarcely sad, scarcely
regretful. It was the smile of content with
which a woman bends over a bowl of dried
rose-leaves, and feels again the warmth of the
sun, and sees the glitter and the blueness of
the day when the leaves were red.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IX">IX</h2>
</div>


<p><span class='smcap'>It</span> was grey and cheerless in Paris, while Anne
sat in the sunshine of Rome.</p>

<p>Winter had set in early, and in François’s
studio the stove piled with fuel was almost
insufficient to warm the great room.</p>

<p>It was as he had suggested, the typical
luxurious studio of a rich man.</p>

<p>A broad divan under the window, was piled
with cushions, and supported by them in
an attitude suggestive of extreme comfort,
François sat and smoked while he talked to
an old friend.</p>

<p>The Vicomte de Montmédy, rich now,
through his marriage with an American
heiress, was a lover of the arts, a connoisseur
and a buyer of pictures.</p>

<p>Fontenelle had known him in the days
when he was only a struggling and unsuccessful
painter.</p>

<p>His title and his noble birth, had stood
him in better stead than his talent. That this
was of an inferior quality to his fine taste in

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
art, François had early recognized, and his
felicitations on the subject of his prudent
marriage had therefore gained an added
warmth and fervour of approval.</p>

<p>The two men had been talking while the
daylight waned, and when François, finding
his match-box empty, rose to refill it from a
jar on a side table, he paused to glance
with a shiver upon the prospect outside the
window.</p>

<p>The studio looked upon the Luxembourg
Gardens. The trees were bare now, and their
branches showed black and stiff against a
wintry sky.</p>

<p>The paths underneath them, in summer
gay as the flower beds, with children and
their nurses, were now lightly powdered with
the first fall of snow.</p>

<p>“I ought to have gone abroad,” he declared,
lighting a cigarette. “If it were not for these
confounded commissions, I should be in Rome
at this moment. There’s no light here. It’s
abominable!”</p>

<p>“Why Rome?” asked the Vicomte lazily.</p>

<p>“I love Rome. And then sweet Anne
Page is there, and she’s always an attraction.”</p>

<p>The other man looked up quickly. “By
the way, it’s <em>her</em> portrait the Luxembourg has
bought, isn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.” He made a quick movement.
“Good heavens man, it’s here, and I’ve never
shown it to you. I forgot you hadn’t seen
it. It goes next week. I kept it to do a little
work on the background first.”</p>

<p>“Quick! Show me before the light goes,”
urged his friend. “I was always curious
about it.”</p>

<p>François crossed the studio rapidly, and
returned with a large canvas.</p>

<p>“The best thing I ever did in my life,”
he said deliberately, as he placed it on an
easel in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>The Vicomte had risen, and in a silence
that lasted for some time the men stood before
the picture.</p>

<p>“Charming!” he murmured at last.
“Adorable! They’ve picked out the right
thing, <i lang='fr'>mon ami, hein</i>? The smile! How well
one remembers it. So sweet, and so shy.
And that flowered gown. Admirable! It
suggests one of the Botticelli Madonnas. It
might be a robe all sown with stars. And
the hair, that delicious soft hair that was no
particular colour—<i lang='fr'>couleur de miel</i>, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Mistress Anne Page? She has brown
hair, and speaks small, like a woman,” quoted
François softly.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span></p>

<p>“It’s Shakespeare. And it’s Anne Page,”
he answered smiling.</p>

“And the flowers!<del>”</del> The great sheaf of
flowers she’s carrying. They’re English, and
‘sweet-Anne’ too.”

<p>Fontenelle looked amused. “You always
pronounced it like that,—as one word!”
he said.</p>

<p>“I used to think it <em>was</em> one word. Just
a Christian name; a lovely name.”</p>

<p>He joined in his friend’s laugh.</p>

<p>“When did you do this?” he asked after
a moment.</p>

<p>“Just before she went.”</p>

<p>“Was I away then?”</p>

<p>“You were just married. You had gone
to America with your wife.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I stayed a year. But when I came
back why didn’t you show it to me?”</p>

<p>“I put it away. She wouldn’t accept it,
and I didn’t want to see it, after she had gone.
I never looked at it again till last spring.
Paul! Do you know that picture’s been
painted eighteen years, and I’ve never done
anything to touch it since? Encouraging,
isn’t it? Something to congratulate one’s self
upon.”</p>

<p>The last words were accompanied by a
bitter laugh. His friend was silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span></p>

<p>“Here comes tea,” said François, with an
abrupt change of voice.</p>

<p>His <i lang='fr'>femme de ménage</i> entered with a tray
which she placed on one of the tables. She
went out, and re-entered with the spirit lamp
and kettle.</p>

<p>“<i lang='fr'>Voilà, Monsieur!</i>”</p>

<p>François began to put the tea into the
teapot.</p>

<p>“Antoinette brews it abominably; I always
make it myself,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“This tea-habit dates from ‘Sweet Anne’s’
time, doesn’t it?” asked the Vicomte.</p>

<p>“I believe it does. Do you remember
the flat in the Rue Vaugirard? And Anne
pouring out tea on winter afternoons?”</p>

<p>Before the other man could answer, he
turned to the picture again.</p>

<p>“I painted that as a sort of memory of the
first day I saw her, in an old English garden.
Did I ever tell you how we four, the old four,
you know, first met Anne Page? <em>You</em> only
knew her here in Paris, when she had learnt to
dress, when she had learnt to talk, when she
had grown used to us and our ways. We saw
her in her garden, when she knew no one,
when from year’s end to year’s end she spoke
to no one but the invalid old woman with
whom she lived.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span></p>

<p>“What were you four doing in her garden?”
inquired the Vicomte, helping himself to sugar.</p>

<p>“Well, René was in England. He was
often there, visiting his relations—his mother’s
people.</p>

<p>“You know he was educated in England?
Went to school there, to Beaumont, and
afterwards lived some time in London. René
was an Englishman with at least half his
nature. And he loved England because of his
mother. Well, he wrote to me that year—to
Thouret, Dacier and me, to suggest that we
should join him for the summer. He told us
he’d found a gorgeous village, where we could
all paint and write, and go on with our beastly
art as much as we liked. We thought it
wouldn’t be bad, so we said all right, and
packed up our traps and went.</p>

<p>“Have some more tea? Well, another
cigarette?</p>

<p>“Dymfield is in Warwickshire, <i lang='fr'>mon cher</i>,”
he went on, striking a match, “<ins title='original: And'>and</ins> Warwickshire
is Shakespeare’s county, and Anne
Page is one of Shakespeare’s women. So it
was all as right as it could be.</p>

<p>“We put up at the inn. The Falcon it was
called. Such a jolly old place! Sixteenth century.
Yawning fireplaces, beams, oak staircases,
walls a yard thick. You know the sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span></p>

<p>“And the village! Thatched roofs all
stained with moss. Oh, the colour of those
roofs! Cottage gardens full of hollyhocks
and roses. Such a church! If you’ve ever
seen a really beautiful English village, you’ll
know what I’m talking about. Dymfield is
one of them.”</p>

<p>“And how did you get to know Anne?”</p>

<p>“Well, René’s mother had been a friend of
the rich woman of the place, an old lady who
no more deserved to possess Fairholme Court
than she deserved Anne as her companion.”</p>

<p>“Cantankerous?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about her moral
qualities. Her taste was execrable. Anyhow
René made his mother responsible for taking
us to see the place—a wonderful jumble of
every style from the fifteenth century downward.
But beautiful! <i lang='fr'>Mon <ins title='original: dieu'>Dieu</ins></i>, beautiful as
a dream. And Fate was kind. The old lady
was ill in bed, and sweet Anne—I told you
she was her companion, didn’t I?—was forced
to do the honours.”</p>

<p>François got up, and began to pace up and
down the floor as he talked.</p>

<p>“We were all packed into the drawing-room
to wait, the first time we called, and
while René was making absurd remarks about
the sofa cushions, and the bead mats, and the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
whole chamber of horrors, I caught sight of
Anne coming across the lawn.</p>

<p>“She wore that gown.” He nodded towards
the portrait. “An absurd thing really,
but it suited her because it showed her
figure.”</p>

<p>“Her figure was superb,” murmured the
Vicomte.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Fontenelle paused a moment. “Even at
the time,” he said rather slowly, “I wondered
how she would strike René. Because
she wasn’t really beautiful, you know. Certainly
not in those days. Only remarkable
looking, curious, and very sweet.”</p>

<p>“But he was struck too?”</p>

<p>“I remember he looked up suddenly, and
said, ‘By Jove, who on earth is this? It’s
some garden goddess or other. Flora. Yes,
that’s it,—Flora. Good Lord, let’s run out
and burn incense or something!’</p>

<p>“She had a heap of flowers, branches of
lilac and hawthorn and things, in one arm,
supported against her hip, and with the other
hand she held her dress away from her feet.
She was moving quickly across the grass.
You know how she walks?</p>

<p>“Then she came into the drawing-room,
and we saw her curious face.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span></p>

<p>“There it is!” said the Vicomte, with his
eyes on the portrait. “You’ve got it exactly.
Something between a Botticelli Madonna and
a pagan goddess—Flora is admirable. But it’s
the sort of face that it takes a painter to admire.”</p>

<p>“She had been considered hideous all her
life, of course. She thought herself desperately
plain. Even when we burnt incense,—and
René at once began to send it up in
clouds,—she thought we were laughing at her.”
François laughed gently himself.</p>

<p>“You remember Anne? You know how
she would take praise. Adorably, like a little
girl who is almost too shy to be pleased. It
was absurd, of course. She was by no means
young even then, remember. But somehow
that only made it more piquante. Anne is one
of the few women for whom age is an absurd
convention. Quite meaningless, quite beside
the point. The goddesses are immortal.”</p>

<p>“But there was nothing of the goddess
about her nature,” objected his friend.</p>

<p>“Good heavens, no! Except physically.
She’s a mortal woman if ever there was one.
She’s just what she always was, sweet Anne
Page.”</p>

<p>Twilight was creeping into the studio.
The polished floor with its costly rugs, the
pictures on the walls, the outlines of cabinets

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
and tables, all were growing dim and indistinct.
The last light from the window above the
men’s heads fell across the face of the portrait
on the easel. It looked down upon them
gently with the wavering uncertain smile in
the eyes, and on the lips, red and soft as the
petals of a rose.</p>

<p>“René saw a great deal of her that summer,
I suppose?” asked the Vicomte, breaking a
silence.</p>

<p>“We all did. The gods for their own
inscrutable purposes had decided Anne’s fate.
The old lady got weaker and insisted upon
having a hospital nurse. She was in her room
all day in bed, and Anne was bidden to entertain
us.</p>

<p>“When we were not in her garden, she was
at the old barn which René and I had rigged
up as a studio.</p>

<p>“She amazed us all. Do you know those
tightly shut buds on a rose-tree, that you think
will never open? And then the sun shines,
and gradually, very slowly, a little every day,
they grow pinker and sweeter, till at last they
are roses?</p>

<p>“I think the sun came out for Anne that
year, for the first time in her life.</p>

<p>“We made her laugh. I don’t believe she
had ever laughed before. And we discovered

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
that she had brains, and taste and understanding,
and <em>instinct</em> for everything that fired
our young brains. Instinct is the word for
Anne. It’s a sixth sense with her. The only
sense it’s any good for a woman to possess.
The very sense that nowadays with their
education and their emancipation, and their
‘rights,’ women are doing their best to kill.</p>

<p>“And she’d read, <i lang='fr'>mon cher</i>. Good heavens,
what she’d read! The modern English woman
with her smattering of Latin and Greek, is an
ill-educated prig beside her. For five years
she had been shut up in a library, and I believe
she had read everything worth reading in her
own literature, and much of ours too, for that
matter. And I, who like René am partly
English by education at least, know what
that means. It’s a magnificent literature for
those who have ears to hear, and a heart to
understand.”</p>

<p>He began to light one of the lamps, stooping
over it as he talked.</p>

<p>“She used to read poetry to us sometimes.
Thouret and Dacier knew very little English
then, but they could understand the simple
things when she read them. I can hear
Thouret now, trying to say after her—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indenttq">“‘<cite>I sing of times trans-shifting; and I write</cite></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><cite>How Roses first came red, and Lilies white.</cite>’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span></p>
<p>François laughed, as he mimicked the
accent of his friend the novelist, who since
the days of which he talked, had attained an
almost European reputation.</p>

<p>“That’s Herrick. You don’t know him?
Well, he’s an English seventeenth-century
poet, and he wrote on purpose for a woman
as simple and natural as Anne Page. She
used to read him to us in an old walled
garden, where in June that year, the lilies
were ‘coming white.’”</p>

<p>“And Dampierre?” asked the Vicomte.
“I didn’t know Dampierre in those days,
remember. Tell me something about him.”</p>

<p>He spoke as one speaks of a great man
who is dead, whose lightest word is of importance
to the admirers who survive him.</p>

<p>“René was twenty-seven then,” said
François, slowly. “He was a year younger
than I. You know how he looked? He
was like his mother. Quite magnificent. Oh
sometimes absurdly handsome, when the right
mood affected his face. He used to dress
like an Englishman in those days, in white
flannels. When he and Anne walked together
they were worth looking at, I can tell
you.”</p>

<p>“But she was, what was it? Seven—ten
years older?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. She remembered that,” returned
François.</p>

<p>His companion glanced quickly in his
direction. He had never heard the whole
story, and his curiosity was roused; but something
in his friend’s voice assured him that it
would not be gratified.</p>

<p>He made a tentative effort, however, by a
suggestion half seriously offered.</p>

<p>“<i lang='fr'>Mon ami</i>, you were in love with her
yourself.”</p>

<p>François echoed his light laugh. “No,”
he declared. “No. My feeling for her now
is what it has always been. I have paid
her the compliment of thinking of her in a
different way from every other woman I ever
met. And I’ve never arrived at defining
that way to myself. An English writer—I’m
boring you to death with English writers
to-day,—comes nearest to it in his definition
of religion. He says ‘<cite>religion is morality
touched by emotion</cite>.’</p>

<p>“Well, I believe what I have always felt
for Anne Page is affectionate morality,” he
laughed again, “strict morality mind, touched
with emotion.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen her lately?”</p>

<p>“I saw her last June, for the first time in
three or four years.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span></p>

<p>“She’s altered, of course?”</p>

<p>“She has. She’s more beautiful. She’s
really beautiful now, so that even the turnip-headed
people she lives among see and
acknowledge it.”</p>

<p>“That’s rather wonderful.”</p>

<p>“You would think so, if you saw her with
them. She’s the village goddess and oracle.
Giving to charities with both hands, petitioned
for advice and counsel, loved by every one,
high and low. That’s not surprising. Nor
is it more surprising, I suppose, that she’s
happy. Her nature is essentially simple and
maternal. She ought to have had children
and children’s children by now.”</p>

<p>He got up and switched on all the lights,
revealing the spacious room, and the beautiful
things it contained; revealing also once more
the portrait on the easel.</p>

<p>The Vicomte again examined it. “The
Luxembourg has made a good choice,” he
repeated. “It’s a beautiful thing, <i lang='fr'>mon cher</i>.
Gracious, dignified, sweet—but sad. In spite
of the smile, because of it, I suppose, profoundedly
sad. But why? She was not, she
is not a sad woman.”</p>

<p>François was moving about the room,
rearranging the canvases against the wall.</p>

<p>“She was sad then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span></p>

<p>The Vicomte waited, but François said no
more, and the conversation turned upon other
matters.</p>

<p>As he rose to go, he stooped to examine
a little sketch propped up on the top of a
cabinet, against the wall.</p>

<p>“That’s rather nice,” he remarked critically.
“It’s the little woman I met here the other
day, isn’t it? Dark. Pretty. English. Who
is she?”</p>

<p>“A Mrs. Dakin. By the way, she’s one
of Anne Page’s friends. One of the people
in her village. She’s staying here with
Madame Didier.”</p>

<p>“Louis Didier’s wife? Did they know
her then?” asked his friend quickly.</p>

<p>“Who? Anne? No. It was all ages
before their time. Louis has only been in
Paris five or six years.”</p>

<p>“So much the better. That woman’s a
cat, <i lang='fr'>mon cher</i>. Sleek fur, claws and all.”</p>

<p>“Madame Didier? I agree,” returned
François with a laugh. “The typical English
devotee of Mrs. Grundy. Louis goes in
mortal fear of her.”</p>

<p>“<i lang='fr'>Tant pis!</i>” exclaimed the Vicomte, with
an accent of commiseration.</p>

</div>


<p><span class='smcap'>Towards</span> the middle of December, Mrs.
Carfax became possessed with the idea of
going to London.</p>

<p>Various circumstances had combined to
render her projected visit pleasurably fraught
with interest.</p>

<p>There was shopping to be done, of course.
There was also Sylvia to embrace;—Sylvia
whose holidays were so short that she herself
had suggested the advisability of staying in
town for Christmas, in order not to interrupt
her work.</p>

<p>Naturally Mrs. Carfax was anxious to see
her child. Naturally also she looked forward
to staying with the Lovells, who were old
friends, and had a comfortable house in Bayswater.</p>

<p>Then too, she had been deeply interested
to hear that the niece who was visiting Mrs.
Lovell, was none other than the Madame
Didier who had invited Mrs. Dakin to Paris.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dakin had not yet returned to

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
Dymfield, and it was natural and neighbourly
of Mrs. Carfax to feel as much interest in her
protracted absence, as that which palpitated
in every Dymfield breast. In a few days she
would be in the position of knowing all that
Madame Didier knew about her late guest.
And then there was Sylvia of course, and the
shopping, and the delight of meeting her dear
friends the Lovells. Mrs. Carfax was quite
determined to go.</p>

<p>“I shall take the three o’clock train this
afternoon,” she announced to the Vicar at
breakfast time, “and send a telegram to Laura.
She is quite ready for me, and urges me to
come at once.”</p>

<p>“Very well, my dear,” agreed the Vicar.
“Please yourself of course, though I scarcely
think it necessary. You were in town only
three months ago.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think it necessary to see
Sylvia, who is not coming home for Christmas?”
demanded his wife. “Well, I do. I
have the feelings of a mother after all, and
I think it’s cruel to leave the poor child up
there, with never the sight of a home face.”</p>

<p>“Please yourself, my dear, as I have
already said. There seems to be a spirit of
great unrest working amongst us,” he went
on, stirring his second cup of coffee irritably.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
“There’s Miss Page abroad, and Sylvia away,
and Mrs. Dakin not yet returned. And now
you——”</p>

<p>“Children, go upstairs if you’ve finished
your breakfast,” interrupted their mother.
“Johnny, say grace. Now all of you go and
get your lessons ready for Miss Hope. She’ll
be here in a minute.”</p>

<p>There was a stampede to the door, and
when it closed on the last child, Mrs. Carfax
turned to her husband.</p>

<p>“It’s most extraordinary about Mrs. Dakin,
isn’t it?” she exclaimed. “And such a
strange thing that this Madame Didier should
be Major Lovell’s niece. I heard something
once about a niece of his having married a
Frenchman, but I never knew her name. I
shall probably hear all about Mrs. Dakin from
her.”</p>

<p>“Then my dear Mary, if you do, I hope
you will be discreet.”</p>

<p>“Discreet, George? What do you mean?
Am I not always discreet?”</p>

<p>The Vicar prudently disregarded the question.</p>

<p>“What I wish to point out, is this,” he
returned. “The duty of taking broad and
charitable views. There is a reasonable explanation
of Mrs. Dakin’s absence. I met

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Dakin yesterday, and he told me it was a question
of his wife’s health. She’s seeing some
doctor in Paris, and going through a course of
treatment.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carfax sniffed. “With her own husband
a doctor!”</p>

<p>“My dear, you know as well as I do that
doctors seldom attend their wives.”</p>

<p>“You annoy me, George. You speak as
though I should be glad to hear that there was
any other reason. I’m sure I hope with all
my heart it’s the true one. But everybody is
talking about it, and I must say I think the
poor man looks very unhappy.”</p>

<p>“Broad views,” returned the Vicar, clearing
his throat, “are those which in Christian charity
we should always endeavour to assume with
regard to our fellows. Let us remember also,
that we have neither part nor lot in this matter.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you tell me straight out to
mind my own business?” asked Mrs. Carfax
angrily. “It’s what you mean. And we’re
not in church, so you needn’t beat about
the bush. You only take ‘broad views’ as
you call them, when you want to be annoying
and put me in the wrong. You know as well
as I do that it’s not right for a wife to stay
months away from her husband. Dr. Dakin
must be a fool to allow it. At the same time,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
you know how delighted I should be if it <em>is</em> all
right. And yet you pretend to think that in a
spirit of vulgar curiosity I’m going up to town
on purpose to gossip and try to find out things
which don’t concern me! My object in going,
as you know, is to see Sylvia——”</p>

<p>“And to do some shopping. Yes, my dear.
Yes. You’ve said so many times,” interrupted
her husband, rising. “You’d better tell Mark
to bring the trap round at half-past two.”</p>

<p>The Vicar closed the breakfast-room door
with a slightly firm touch.</p>

<p>“Is mamma going to London to-day?”
shouted Johnny, who regardless of lesson books,
was sliding down the banisters outside.</p>

<p>“I believe so. I trust it may do her good,”
answered his father piously. “Go upstairs, at
once, and get ready for Miss Hope.”</p>

<p>He entered his study, and with some disinclination,
sat down to the sermon for which
a more deferential hearing might possibly be
anticipated than that accorded in the home
circle.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mrs. Carfax arrived at Rushworth Terrace
just in time to dress for dinner. Madame
Didier, to whom she was presented in the
drawing-room just before the gong sounded,
was a tall young woman of twenty-seven or

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
twenty-eight, with a sharp face and a thin
pointed nose. Her fair hair was arranged
neatly over her forehead, and her dress, though
fashionable, was undistinguished.</p>

<p>“Helen doesn’t look a bit French, does
she?” asked her aunt.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lovell was a fat comfortable woman
with no figure, and less intelligence.</p>

<p>“I’m glad she’s kept so English. One
would have thought that living in Paris so
long would have made a Frenchwoman of her.”</p>

<p>“We should quarrel if it had!” declared
the Major in a loud voice. “I don’t like
foreigners. Can’t stand ’em. Beg your pardon,
my dear. I forgot your husband!”</p>

<p>He laughed heartily. “But you must
excuse me. I’ve never seen him, and I dare
say you’ve made an Englishman of him.
Hope so, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing would make an Englishman
of Louis, I’m sorry to say,” answered Madame
Didier. “He can’t bear England. We’re
always fighting about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, come along! Dinner. Dinner.
I’m famished,” declared the Major.</p>

<p>“Come along, Mrs. Carfax. How’s your
husband? And the children? All well, eh?
That’s right.”</p>

<p>“I’m so interested to hear that you know a

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
neighbour of ours,” began Mrs. Carfax during
the first favourable opportunity at dinner-time.</p>

<p>“Oh! Madge Dakin? Yes. Aunt Laura
has been telling me that you are neighbours.
She has been staying with us in Paris, as of
course you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m so sorry to hear she is ill.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carfax helped herself to bread sauce,
and waited in suspense.</p>

<p>“Madge is never quite so ill as she thinks
she is,” replied Madame Didier in her decisive
voice. “It’s all a question of nerves with her.
However, I suggested she should go to a doctor
who did me a great deal of good some time
ago. I’m a <em>real</em> sufferer from nerves. And
as I couldn’t keep her any longer—I had visits
to pay and so on,—she is boarding with some
people in Paris to go on with the treatment.”</p>

<p>The explanation, delivered in Madame
Didier’s high thin voice, seemed sufficiently
reasonable. Yet Mrs. Carfax was conscious
of an under-current.</p>

<p>Her hostess was silent, but the Major,
always garrulous, broke in with one of his
pet grievances which lasted till the end of
the meal, and ended by proving anew, through
many ramifications, that the country was going
to the dogs.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room, when coffee was

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
served after dinner, and her host had gone
to the smoking-room, circumstances for Mrs.
Carfax were more propitious.</p>

<p>Madame Didier took out her embroidery,
and Mrs. Lovell lay back in an easy-chair, and
warmed her feet at the fire.</p>

<p>“Helen has been telling me a good deal
about this Mrs. Dakin,” she began.</p>

<p>Her tone suggested that further confidences
might be expected from Mrs. Dakin’s friend,
and Mrs. Carfax sat upright in her chair, and
leant forward a little.</p>

<p>“Oh, but if Mrs. Carfax is a friend——”
objected Madame Didier.</p>

<p>“Well, dear, so are you,” put in Mrs.
Lovell, who<ins>,</ins> as Mrs. Carfax suddenly decided<ins>,</ins>
was really quite stupid.</p>

<p>Madame Didier’s offended expression might
portend anything—even silence.</p>

<p>Innocent of psychology, Mrs. Carfax could
not be expected to know that on this score,
at least, she need have no apprehension.</p>

<p>“Of course I am Madge’s friend,” said
Madame Didier, stitching very fast, “and
that’s why I am so distressed at her foolish
behaviour.”</p>

<p>“What has she——?” Mrs. Carfax paused.
It was perhaps safer not to interrupt.</p>

<p>“Oh only that she rather annoyed me by

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
flirting outrageously with a man who sometimes
comes to our house. A man I don’t like.
But he’s a friend of Louis’s, and so I have to
put up with him. A Monsieur Fontenelle.”</p>

<p>“Why, I met him last spring, at a dinner-party!”
interrupted Mrs. Carfax in surprise.</p>

<p>“So I heard.”</p>

<p>The brief words were enigmatic in tone,
and Mrs. Carfax gave an uncomprehending
gasp.</p>

<p>“He’s a celebrated man, as of course you
know. He was made President of the International
Art Congress this summer, here in
London. And he’s naturally a splendid
painter. But he’s not a nice man. Few
Frenchmen are.”</p>

<p>Madame Didier shut her thin lips, and bent
over her embroidery.</p>

<p>“You mean——?” began Mrs. Carfax
timidly.</p>

<p>“If he were an Englishman, he would have
a very bad reputation. But in Paris—well!”
Madame Didier shrugged her shoulders.
“There’s no such thing as morality. I need
not tell you that <em>I</em> have never grown accustomed
to it. I still keep my English ideas
as to right and wrong.”</p>

<p>“I’m thankful you do, dear Helen,” murmured
her aunt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span></p>

<p>“I warned Madge,” pursued her friend.
“I told her all I had heard about him. Louis
was angry with me, but I thought it my duty.”</p>

<p>“But she hasn’t——? I mean there isn’t
any danger of—of a divorce, or anything of
that kind?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carfax involuntarily lowered her voice
to a horrified whisper.</p>

<p>“Oh no! no! Let us hope it won’t come
to that. Mind, I’m not accusing Madge of
anything but foolish flirting. She made a
dead set at him, I must say that. I don’t
believe that otherwise he would have taken
any notice of her. But Madge is so vain.
And then she has an idea she isn’t happy
with her husband. Well! a wife must make
the best of the man she marries. I make a
point of getting on with Louis.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you do, dear,” interrupted her
aunt. “You’re so wise.”</p>

<p>“But you think she’s really staying on
to——?”</p>

<p>“I fear that the excuse of her illness is
only half true. She’s staying on I believe
to—well, to go on with the flirtation, let us
say.”</p>

<p>Madame Didier laughed a little, and took
a fresh thread of silk.</p>

<p>“Madge is a nice little thing, of course,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
but she’s very flighty. I can’t help thinking
that she must have fallen under some bad
influence lately. She comes from <em>such</em> a
good home. I used to stay with her at her
father’s house just outside York, when we
were schoolgirls. The Etheridges are county
people, you know. Not very rich, but well
connected, and in the <em>nicest</em> set. No fastness
or anything horrid of that sort. The right
sort of quiet county people. You know
what I mean. We rather thought she might
have done better than a country doctor.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Dakin is <em>extremely</em> well connected,”
put in Mrs. Carfax a little stiffly. He was
a neighbour after all, and she felt that the
slighting reflection might easily extend from
the faculty, to the Church, of which her
husband was so distinguished an ornament.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I’m sure of it,” Madame Didier
hastened to reply. “And a clever man, I
hear.”</p>

<p>“Extremely clever. And devoted to his
wife. This will be a terrible blow.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carfax leant back in her chair, and
wondered whether she should write to George,
or wait till her return. She decided to wait.
A verbal recitation would be more effective.</p>

<p>“Oh! let us hope she will recover her
senses and return to her home. I feel

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
terribly distressed about it, as it was in my
house she met Monsieur Fontenelle.”</p>

<p>“No! She met him first at Miss Page’s,”
corrected Mrs. Carfax. “I <em>thought</em> he seemed
very attentive that evening. He was talking
to her a long time after dinner.”</p>

<p>Madame Didier looked up sharply from
her work.</p>

<p>“Who <em>is</em> this Miss Page?” she asked.
“How does she come to know Monsieur
Fontenelle?”</p>

<p>“She’s a most charming woman. We are
very proud of her at Dymfield. I suppose
she met Monsieur Fontenelle abroad. She
has travelled a great deal.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Madame Didier took another
thread of silk, and matched it carefully.</p>

<p>“I only wondered,” she went on, “because
Madge was so reticent about her. Naturally,
when I saw her becoming so very intimate with
Monsieur Fontenelle, I inquired about the
woman who was responsible for the first
introduction. But I could gather nothing
from Madge except that Miss Page was a
beautiful woman, and apparently a paragon
of all the virtues.”</p>

<p>Madame Didier sniffed slightly, and began
to fold up her work.</p>

<p>“She’s certainly a striking looking woman,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
and most generous and charitable,” returned
Mrs. Carfax. “My husband would not know
what to do without her financial and other
help, in the parish. Certainly we know very
little about her life before she settled at
Dymfield ten years ago,” she added rather
uncertainly.</p>

<p>“Good works are the modern equivalent
for the convent, aren’t they?” suggested
Madame Didier.</p>

<p>“She’s a charming woman,” repeated Mrs.
Carfax in a slightly dazed voice.</p>

<p>“No doubt. Yet I know one woman who
doesn’t describe her in those terms. Did you
ever meet a Mrs. Crosby? No? Well, she
is firmly convinced that Miss Page robbed
her of her inheritance.”</p>

<p>“If the doctor is at all wise, he will go
and look after his wife,” suggested Aunt Laura,
her remark making a timely but unconscious
diversion.</p>

<p>“I’ll see what I can do,” observed Mrs.
Carfax with significance.</p>

<p>Madame Didier looked a little alarmed.
“Please don’t mention my name!” she begged.
“Remember I have said nothing, and that,
only in Madge’s interest.”</p>

<p>“Discretion is my strong point,” returned
Mrs. Carfax with dignity. “I am no gossip,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
and the last thing in the world I should wish
to do, is to make mischief.”</p>

<p>“You are always so wise, dear Mary,”
murmured Mrs. Lovell.</p>

<p>The ladies talked till a late hour, and
Mrs. Carfax went to bed full of an excitement
which she was shocked to recognize as
distinctly pleasurable.</p>

<p><span class='smcap'>Tiring</span> a little of hotel life, Anne had taken
an apartment on the heights close to the
Church of the <ins title='original: Trinita'>Trinità</ins> dei Monti.</p>

<p>In her sunny room overlooking the city,
in the intervals between her rambles, or the
interchange of visits, she spent quiet happy
hours. In Rome, as in no other Italian city,
time slipped back, and the life of twenty years
ago seemed often more real, more tangible,
than her existence of to-day.</p>

<p>Over and over again, in Rome, she was
startled to find herself living not in the present,
but in the memory of an unforgetable past.</p>

<p>One morning, in walking through the
Farnesina Palace, she stopped before a window
to look down upon a narrow walled garden.
The paths were mossy and weed-grown; the
whole place pervaded by that air of neglect
and decay, common to Italian gardens. But
at the end of the enclosed oblong space, there
was a beautiful old gate of marble. Orange
trees in rows, ran the length of the right-hand

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
wall, and between the glossy leaves, the fruit
shone golden. In the centre grass plot, amidst
the long unkempt grass, there were rose bushes
with pale pink monthly roses upon them; and
overhead a roof of sky blue as the heart of a
gentian.</p>

<p>Miss Page turned her head quickly, a half
smile upon her lips, as though to speak to
some one at her side.</p>

<p>It was twenty years since she had looked
down upon that quiet garden, but the illusion
of a bygone day was so strong, that she
expected to meet a responsive smile.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The summer of which François Fontenelle
had spoken to his friend, as he sat
beneath Anne’s portrait, was the summer
which followed her visit to her brother and
his wife.</p>

<p>Anne had returned with her inner life
wrecked and shattered. Her peace of mind
was gone. She spent no more quiet days in
the library with her books. A feverish restlessness
drove her out of doors, where while
daylight lasted, she worked among her plants,
digging, weeding, planting with such energy
that from sheer physical fatigue, she forced
herself to sleep dreamlessly till morning
renewed her toil. She was uninterrupted. No

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
one disturbed her. She had nothing else
to do.</p>

<p>In spite of her protestations, Mrs. Burbage
who had been growing steadily feebler through
the winter, sent for a hospital nurse, and finally
kept her bed.</p>

<p>“I will be looked after by the right
people,” she declared with characteristic determination.
“Trained nurses are the right
people to tend the sick. I can afford to
pay for them, and I will have them. You
have had enough waiting upon invalids, my
dear.”</p>

<p>Freed from nearly all her customary
duties, therefore, Anne had the long spring
days before her, and with the instinct of her
healthy nature, she strove by hard physical
work, to fill them, and at the same time to
crush out the mental malady which tore at
her heart.</p>

<p>“It’s a disease, but work will kill it,” she
told herself.</p>

<p>And she set her teeth, and worked.</p>

<p>She worked; but she was burdened with a
great fear and a great regret.</p>

<p>Immersed in books, as for the last five
years she had become, she had not hitherto
noticed the isolation, the narrowness of her
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span></p>

<p>Not only had she failed to miss the intercourse
of her fellow creatures, she had actually
dreaded their approach.</p>

<p>Filled with a nervous mistrust of her own
power to please, she had shunned humanity
as represented by any living soul outside the
gates of Fairholme Court.</p>

<p>“I know nothing about any one,” was the
dreary burden of her thoughts. “I don’t
understand anything about real men and
women. My own life is empty, and so for
me, the lives of others are empty too. I have
nothing to say to them, no help to give them,
I’m useless in a world of which I know nothing
except at second hand. And as I grow older
my heart will dry up and wither more and
more, till I’m an old maid—the conventional
old maid.”</p>

<p>She planted her sad thoughts with the beds
of lilies; she dug them into the ground round
the rose-bushes; and serenely, mockingly, the
garden flourished and broke gradually into a
flood of bloom.</p>

<p>It had never looked so beautiful as on the
day when Mrs. Burbage’s maid came to her
while she was watering the new rose hedge
round the sundial, to say that visitors had
called, and her mistress wished Miss Page
to receive them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span></p>

<p>The lilac bushes were cascades of amethyst
bloom; the hawthorn trees were dazzling
white, or rosy to their utmost branch. Anne
had broken off great sprays of blossom which
lay at the foot of the sundial, ready to be
taken into the house.</p>

<p>She picked them up, and full of consternation
and trembling shyness, made her way
across the lawn, and entered the drawing-room
by one of the long French windows.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that the room was full of
men, and she put out her hand blindly to the
tallest of them, murmuring incoherent words.</p>

<p>“I am René Dampierre,” he said. “I’m
so sorry Mrs. Burbage is ill. She knew my
mother, and me too when I was a child. I
should like to have seen her.”</p>

<p>The words, spoken with the faintest foreign
accent, were quite fluent, and the voice was
beautiful, the gentlest man’s voice Anne had
ever heard. She ventured to look at him,
and involuntarily she smiled, her confidence
restored.</p>

<p>He was very tall, she noticed, and big, and
bronzed to the roots of his thick straw-coloured
hair. His eyes were brown. Even at the
moment, Anne was conscious of surprise. She
had expected them to be blue. But they were
eyes which drove away her shyness, and she

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
was able to shake hands calmly with his friends
as he introduced them.</p>

<p>“This is François Fontenelle, a painter
like myself. And this is Thouret, who writes
very bad verse and worse novels, and this is
Dacier who does everything—also very badly.
All my friends. And you—Mademoiselle?”</p>

<p>“I am Anne Page,” she said, and to her
<del>her</del> own amazement, she laughed.</p>

<p>They all looked so friendly, and they were
not at all alarming.</p>

<p>“Anne Page? That is a Shakespeare
name!” exclaimed the young man whom Dampierre
had first introduced.</p>

<p>“Shakespeare?” repeated Dacier. “<i lang='fr'>Ah!
Si je pouvais seulement parler Anglais, mademoiselle!</i>”</p>

<p>“I can speak a little French,” said Anne
timidly. “But you <ins title='original: musn’t'>mustn’t</ins> laugh at my
accent.”</p>

<p>They surrounded her then, talking a babel
of mixed French and English, and Anne found
herself laughing with them, as she tried to
reply to their questions.</p>

<p>“May we see the garden?” asked René
Dampierre presently. “Oh no! don’t put
down the flowers! I would offer to take
them, but if they are not in your way, do
carry them. They are just right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span></p>

<p>“Oh yes! the goddess of the garden must
keep her flowers,” insisted Dacier.</p>

<p>Anne kept them uncomprehendingly, since
her compliance seemed to please her guests.</p>

<p>She was mystified. But they were all
friendly and kind, and easy to entertain. She
had spoken to few men in her life, and she did
not know there were any like these. It was a
new sensation to be addressed with deference,
and regarded with attention.</p>

<p>Never before had Anne felt flattered, and
the sensation was agreeable.</p>

<p>She took them to her rose garden, and
showed them the quaint old sundial, which,
at her instigation, the gardener had brought
from an outhouse in which she had discovered
it, and set up in a space enclosed by clipped
yews.</p>

<p>She showed them her borders of snowy
pinks, with the lavender bushes behind them,
and the garden she was making, a fancy of
her own, (new then,) in which only Shakespeare’s
flowers should grow.</p>

<p>“There are a great many, you see,” she
told them. “And such nice old-fashioned
plants. Rue and marjoram, and lavender,
and marigolds. I love marigolds, don’t you?
They won’t come yet, though.”</p>

<p>“No. They are ‘flowers of middle

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
summer,’” quoted Monsieur Fontenelle. “You
see I know your Shakespeare,” as Anne turned
to him with a smile of pleased surprise.</p>

<p>“And the ‘<cite>daffodils that come before the
swallow dares</cite>’ are nearly over,” said Dampierre.
“But you still have some pale primroses and
the violets.... Now don’t try to show off,
François, because <em>I</em> want to!... ‘<cite>Violets
dim, but sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes
or Cytherea’s breath.</cite>’”</p>

<p>“You are wonderful!” laughed Anne.
“You are Frenchmen, but you know <cite>The
Winter’s Tale</cite>!”</p>

<p>“I ought to. I have been brought up
chiefly in England,” returned Dampierre.
“But Fontenelle is a disgusting genius. He
knows the literature of all languages by
instinct. He was born knowing them. In
his nurse’s arms he terrified his relations by
babbling in English, Italian, Spanish, Hebrew
and Arabic.”</p>

<p>Anne laughed again. “Then he would
like to see the library,” she said. “I will
take you there presently. I’m glad you
approve my Shakespeare garden,” she added,
with a touch of the shyness she had almost
forgotten.</p>

<p>“It’s delicious!” declared René. “That
old wall as a background, and the mass of

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
wallflowers—gillyflowers, Shakespeare calls
them, doesn’t he? And the beds of violets!
The scent of it all! It smells of England.
And I love England, because it’s my mother’s
and Shakespeare’s country.”</p>

<p>“You have some of your own flowers
growing here,” he added, stooping towards
a bed of double narcissus, and glancing up
at Anne with a smile.</p>

<p>“My own flowers?” she repeated, puzzled.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know the country name for
these?” He was still smiling. “<cite>Sweet
Nancies.</cite>”</p>

<p>“And in Shakespeare your name is ‘sweet
Anne Page,’” added Fontenelle, “the prettiest
English name in the world.”</p>

<p>A faint colour came to Anne’s face. She
glanced from one to another with a look half
shy, half pleased, half pitiful.</p>

<p>It gave place to a little movement of
dignity.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you like my name,” she said.</p>

<p>In her voice there was a suggestion of fear.
The fear that these strange yet pleasant young
men were laughing at her. She took them
across the sunny lawn, where the beech
tree’s silken leaves had still the freshness of
spring. A thousand birds were singing and
calling. The scent of the lilac hung in the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
air, and the hawthorns were drenched in
fragrant snow.</p>

<p>Before the irregular charming front of the
house, the men paused, and breaking into
French, poured out ecstasies of praise.</p>

<p>“<i lang='fr'>Ravissant! Quelle belle ligne! Que
c’est délicieux!</i>”</p>

<p>“This is the library,” said Anne, as the
men followed her through the open window
into the dim beautiful room.</p>

<p>It was the one room in the house unspoilt
by modern furniture; left just as it had been
in her old friend’s day, with its high-backed
chairs of gilded Spanish leather, its heavy
rich curtains at the window, and the books
reaching from floor to ceiling, their bindings
of calf and leather forming the most harmonious
of decorations. Simultaneously, the
men uttered exclamations of delight.</p>

<p>Fontenelle rushed to one of the shelves,
and became absorbed in the titles of the
books which he read aloud, calling to his
companions now and again, when he had discovered
a treasure. René Dampierre stood
in the embrasure of one of the windows, with
Anne.</p>

<p>“Do you read these books?” he asked,
smiling down at her.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Anne, simply. “I read them

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
for nearly five years. But I haven’t read
anything lately,” she added, involuntarily.</p>

<p>“No? Why not?”</p>

<p>Again the colour rushed to her cheeks, and
her companion, suddenly curious, wondered
what he could have said to destroy her
composure.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she answered hurriedly. “I
have been so busy in the garden. Shall we have
tea out of doors? It’s quite warm enough.”</p>

<p>She left him to give the order, and when
the library door closed, François abandoned
the books, and crossed the room to him.</p>

<p>“But she’s charming!” he exclaimed,
speaking in English. “Isn’t it an unusual
type? That clear pale face and the soft hair,
and the soft voice? I shall get her to sit for me.”</p>

<p>“She’s accustomed to be thought exceedingly
plain,” remarked Dampierre.</p>

<p>Fontenelle made an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>“By the usual idiot perhaps. How do you
know?”</p>

<p>“By her manner. She hasn’t any of the
airs of a pretty woman. She thought we were
laughing at her just now, in the garden.”</p>

<p>“If we made her think herself pretty, <i lang='fr'>mon
cher</i>, she’d surprise us all. There are a
thousand possibilities in that face.”</p>

<p>“<i lang='fr'>Allons!</i> I for one am quite ready,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
laughed Dampierre. “I believe you’re right.
She could be beautiful, though she’s not young.
What do you think? Thirty-two, thirty-three?—or
more?”</p>

<p>François shrugged his shoulders. “It
doesn’t matter. She’s one of the women
for whom age doesn’t count—except as an
improvement.”</p>

<p>“An unusual case.”</p>

<p>“Of course. But she’s unusual. I’m going
to paint her.”</p>

<p>“Tea’s ready,” said Anne, appearing again
at the window. “It was in the drawing-room,
so I just had it carried out.”</p>

<p>She was quite at her ease now, and tea
was a delightful meal under the flickering
shade of the beech tree.</p>

<p>The men praised her French, inquired
how she had learnt it so well; laughed and
chattered; and finally took their leave, with
many invitations to Anne. She must come to
their studio, which was really only a barn. She
must come to tea at the Falcon Inn. It was
quite worth seeing. Above all, they must come
back to the most charming garden in the world.</p>

<p>“<i lang='fr'>Pour revoir la déesse du jardin</i>,” added
Thouret, lifting his hat with a flourish, as she
stood in the porch, watching their departure.</p>

</div>


<p>“<span class='smcap'>So</span> René Dampierre has grown into a handsome
man, has he?” said Mrs. Burbage, when
Anne went to her room.</p>

<p>She was sitting up in bed, with a shawl
thrown round her shoulders.</p>

<p>Her face was yellow and pinched, but the
eyes that looked out from under the wasted
forehead, were sharp and keen as ever.</p>

<p>“Well! so he ought. His mother was a
beautiful creature, and his father was well
enough, as men go. Jacques Dampierre was
quite a celebrated man in Paris, thirty years
ago, when I used to visit them. A writer; a
novelist, I believe. I never read any of his
books. In those days it wasn’t considered the
correct thing for young women to read French
novels. And quite right too. They’re all
disgraceful.</p>

<p>“René’s a painter, you say? Well! much
good may it do him. He won’t make money
that way, though I suppose he must have come
into a decent income through his father. He’s
an only son.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span></p>

<p>“His father is dead then?” Anne asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear, dead long ago. He died
a year after his wife, and that’s fourteen years
now. She was a Leslie, one of the old stock,
and as I say, a lovely girl. Fair, is he? Like
his mother then. Hers was the only real gold
hair I ever saw. And she had brown eyes, like
a deer, or a fawn, or some creature of that sort.”</p>

<p>Anne remembered the brown eyes that
ought to have been blue. He had his mother’s
eyes as well as her hair then, evidently.</p>

<p>“Let me see, René must be twenty-seven
or twenty-eight by this time,” the old lady
went on. “I haven’t seen him since he was
a baby of five or so. He was a pretty boy,
then. They sent him over here to be educated,
at that Catholic place. Beaumont isn’t it?
He ought to be quite an Englishman, and I
hope he is.”</p>

<p>“Well, he speaks English perfectly, with
only the very slightest accent. But I don’t
think he’s at all like an Englishman,” said
Anne. “In manner, I mean,” she added.</p>

<p>“Humph! More’s the pity. I don’t like
foreigners.”</p>

<p>Anne was silent. She thought she did.</p>

<p>“He brought friends, you say? Well, tell
them to come whenever they like, my dear.
You’re quite old enough to look after them.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
Catherine Leslie—Dampierre, I mean, was a
good friend to me. I should like to show
hospitality to her boy.”</p>

<p>She turned over on the pillow, her voice
growing weak.</p>

<p>“That will do, Anne. Nurse will see to
me. I can’t talk ten minutes now without this
dreadful faintness.”</p>

<p>The nurse came up to the bed, and Anne
stepped aside, pausing at the door, to throw
a pitying glance at the sharp profile against
the pillow.</p>

<p>The old lady was growing visibly weaker,
and Anne sorrowed. She was so lonely, so
desolate at the end of life. Childless, almost
friendless, for brusque and downright in
manner, she had never possessed the happy
art of engaging the affection of others, she
was going down to the grave almost
unregarded.</p>

<p>Few of her own generation were alive, and
with the younger race she concerned herself
but little. Anne knew that she had a nephew,
her sister’s child. She had occasionally spoken
of him as her heir, generally with the dry
comment that she grudged him the money.</p>

<p>“He’s a great gaby,” she often declared,
“and his vulgar wife will make ducks and
drakes of my fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span></p>

<p>“But there, my dear, what does it matter?
In the place where I go there’s neither knowledge
nor understanding. It will be all the
same to me.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Anne left the sick-room, and from force
of habit, wandered out into the garden.</p>

<p>“How lonely! How desolate!” she found
herself thinking.</p>

<p>“And I shall be just as lonely, just as
desolate when it comes to my turn.”</p>

<p>She turned her face towards the quiet evening
sky, in which, despite one or two trembling
stars, the flush of sunset still lingered, and again
despair fell like a cold hand upon her heart.</p>

<p>All the afternoon she had felt so gay. She
had been amused, interested, almost flattered.</p>

<p>Now the words she had just heard, recurred
to her. “Tell them to come. You are quite
old enough to look after them.”</p>

<p>A sudden miserable sensation of shame
assailed her, to remember how young she had
felt. In welcoming her visitors, she had not
thought of her age at all. She had accepted
them as equals and contemporaries.</p>

<p>The blinding tears which made her stumble
on the path already dim with twilight, caused
her to bow her head with the instinct of hiding
them even from herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span></p>

<p>“I’m quite old—quite old,” she repeated
with something that was partly a sob, partly
a shiver. “They didn’t make me feel it,
because they are kind, and they have charming
manners. But they are young, and life
is all before them. It’s all over for me—and
I’ve never had it.”</p>

<p>The bats skimmed noiselessly past her, in
the dusk. All the birds had ceased singing.
It was nearly dark, but with a horror of
returning to the house, of being shut within
four walls, Anne sat at the foot of the sundial,
and in the darkness her tears fell.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Yet next morning, in the sunshine, when
René Dampierre came to ask her to the
“studio,” it seemed not only easy, but natural,
to smile, and be well pleased. When she
found herself with her new friends, depressing
thoughts fled like magic.</p>

<p>They were so obviously glad to see her.
They interested her so much with their discussions,
their enthusiasm, their talk, fresh
and new to her, of methods, and values and
style, in painting, in writing, in music, in the
whole world of art to which hitherto she had
travelled alone; speechless, like a ghost
amongst ghosts.</p>

<p>From the outset, Anne saw that René

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
Dampierre was regarded with a certain admiring
respect by his companions. Already
he was considered a great man; already they
looked up to him as a leader, an authority.</p>

<p>Little by little, emerging from her provincial
ignorance, she realized that a world
of art existed in Paris, in which these young
men had already made a place for themselves,
and were recognized. From the first, it was
chiefly through François Fontenelle that her
imagination began to work, began to construct
the life, the surroundings, the whole framework
of existence, with its modern thought, its
ideals, its ambitions, out of which her friends
had for a moment stepped into the stagnant
peacefulness of this English village. It was
with François that she talked most easily.
His fluent speech, his gift of picturesque narration
and description, led her to realize a
new world; gave sight to her eyes, gave her
understanding.</p>

<p>Thouret and Dacier were delightful boys,
younger by three or four years than the other
two friends.</p>

<p>Anne liked them heartily, and was amused
by their boyish high spirits, and nonsense
talk, but her real interest was with François
Fontenelle, and René Dampierre.</p>

<p>With René, her shyness lasted longer than

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
with the others, and often as she searched her
mind for the reason, she could never determine
it, except that as she incoherently put it
to herself, he was “so absurdly good-looking.”</p>

<p>His manner to her was charming, more
charming perhaps than the manner of any of
the others, though they all treated her with
that flattering air of mingled deference and
admiration to which she was growing accustomed.
But despite herself, the little tremor
of confusion when René addressed her, never
ceased to trouble and embarrass her. In the
company of François she was at her ease;
interested, pleased, serene, ready to talk or
to listen. René alone, though she loved him
to talk to her, longed for it in fact with an
intensity for which she often despised herself,
never succeeded in effacing a secret inexplicable
dismay.</p>

<p>The days passed on. May slipped into
a radiant June. It was a brilliant summer,
warm and sunny, the first happy summer Anne
had ever known.</p>

<p>Early in their acquaintance Fontenelle had
asked her to sit to him, and out of doors, in
the garden of Fairholme Court, he made sketch
after sketch.</p>

<p>He was always dissatisfied.</p>

<p>“It isn’t right!” he exclaimed time after

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
time. “You are the most elusive creature in
the world. I don’t think I know you well
enough yet to get down what I want. But
some day I will paint you. You are going
to make my fortune!”</p>

<p>“Then you must come again—many times,”
Anne said.</p>

<p>Even while she spoke, her smile died.</p>

<p>Next summer, who could tell where she
might be? She could not blind herself to
the seriousness of her friend’s illness.</p>

<p>And when she was gone?</p>

<p>Anne refused to look forward. Once long
ago, Mrs. Burbage had told her she need not
be anxious about the future.</p>

<p>“I shall see that you don’t starve, my
dear,” she had said.</p>

<p>But Anne realized that her life would be
very different. It would probably mean facing
the world once more in some sort of struggle
for existence, without the companionship, which
quiet unemotional as it was, meant all she had
ever known of a friendly home, and human
affection.</p>

<p>Often as these reflections assailed her, she
put them from her. This was her summer.
She would not spoil it by thinking of cold rain
and wintry days.</p>

<p>It was while she was sitting to François

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
that they talked most; and always sooner or
later, the conversation centred upon René
Dampierre.</p>

<p>“He has genius,” François assured her
with the generous enthusiasm of an artist for
work that is beyond his own powers.</p>

<p>“We are all desperately excited about
René’s career. He will be great, as Corot, as
Daubigny are great. He is the coming man.
You will see. In ten years time, he will be a
leader, the founder of a new school of painting;
a great power in France. Oh! we’re going
to be proud of René! Unless, of course,” he
added with a change of tone, “he plays the
fool. There’s always that to fear with him.
He must let women alone. They’re the very
devil for smashing up a man’s work; and
that’s René’s weak side. He’s a fool about
women. Just the sort of sentimental fool
who’s capable of marrying one of them. And
if he does——” Fontenelle’s shrug of the
shoulders and the gesture of his disengaged
hand, completed the sentence.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>Anne was accustomed to frank conversation
from François Fontenelle. He discussed his
own love affairs with perfect freedom. He
told her of the adventures of his acquaintances
in Paris, and with a Frenchman’s love of

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
analysis, entered into long discussions on the
psychology of love and passion.</p>

<p>Anne listened calmly. Ignorant as she
was, except through her reading, of the phase
of existence he described, she had by this time
grown to form a very fair idea of the emotional
life of the men in her friend’s set in Paris.
Much of what François said, she heard with
incomprehension, not of the facts, but of the
feelings to which they corresponded. She was
neither shocked nor surprised. François’ conversation
never offended her. He talked to
her frankly as to a grown woman of intelligence,
and she accepted his confidences as
simply as they were offered.</p>

<p>As yet, Anne knew little about herself.
It had never occurred to her to analyze her
own temperament. Throughout her life it
never occurred to her, and in this circumstance
lay the secret of a certain simplicity which to
her dying day she preserved.</p>

<p>It never struck her that her character,
formed in a seclusion unaffected by the clash
of argument and conflicting ethical opinion,
was wide and generous, and original. Free-thinking
in the true sense of the word, inasmuch
as her thoughts were her own, uncoloured by
the prejudices and predilections of any sect or
party. Her life had been forced into a narrow

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
channel, but quite spontaneously, quite naturally,
her nature accepted a wide outlook, and
extended sympathy and tolerance to lives and
standpoints of necessity different from her
own.</p>

<p>To many men apparently, love as she had
dreamed of it, was an utterly different conception
from that she had formed for herself.
She accepted the fact, merely trying to understand.</p>

<p>“Why?” she repeated. “He might find
the right wife.”</p>

<p>François smiled as he looked up from his
drawing, and met her blue eyes, candid as a
child’s, but a woman’s eyes nevertheless.</p>

<p>“Sweet Anne Page!” he exclaimed. “Why
shouldn’t he find the right wife? The chances
are a million to one against it. Even if she
exists. She would have to be a miracle of
self-sacrifice and comprehension, and tact and
wisdom, if she were not to stand in his way.
René is an artist to his finger tips, and if only
out of consideration for women, no great artist
should marry. No! René must always love
and ride away. And the women he loves
must be those who are accustomed to see the
cavalier depart, without grieving. The women
who merely look out for the next.”</p>

<p>Anne was silent. It was a way of love

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
she did not understand. Yet she could imagine
its existence.</p>

<p>“Men must be very different,” she said
after a long pause. <ins>“</ins>That sort of thing would
hurt a woman so much. One sort of woman,
I mean. I think it would kill the best in her,
so that if she were doing any work like painting,
for instance, far from helping her, it would
<em>prevent</em> her from doing as well as she might.”</p>

<p>“Men <em>are</em> different. Most men. And if
women would only recognize the fact, there
would be fewer tears. Love is your whole
existence, as one of your poets says, I believe.
Bryon, is it? For us it’s often an episode,—more
often a series of episodes. Sometimes,
rarely, the other thing. But that for an artist
is not a consummation to be desired. Think!
His whole existence! What becomes of his
work if it’s merged in the life of one woman?
Why it goes to pot, of course,” he went on
with one of his rapid descents into English
slang, which combined with his foreign accent
always made Anne smile.</p>

<p>“No, that’s the price an artist pays—if it’s
a heavy price, which I doubt,” he added with
the cynicism of youth. “No absorbing loves
for him. Love is necessary for his imagination,
of course. It fires him with enthusiasm. It
gives him delight and gaiety, and bestows on

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
him the joyous mind to work. But if he’s a
wise man, no absorbing passions. Above all,
no ties.”</p>

<p>Anne sighed. “I see what you mean. But
it seems that art is very cruel.”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“Then I think if what you say is true, an
artist ought to keep out of the way of any
woman who—cares. But he wouldn’t if she
pleased him,” she added softly.</p>

<p>François laughed. “In your wisdom you
have divined the natural selfishness of man,”
he said.</p>

<p>As the months passed slowly on, a change,
or rather a development gradual but steady,
was taking place in Anne’s nature, a development
that presently made itself manifest in her
appearance, in her attitude, in her demeanour,
physical as well as mental.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely, she was waking to the
consciousness of her womanhood, and of her
power.</p>

<p>The men whom she had grown to know
intimately, regarded her with obvious admiration.</p>

<p>In their eyes at least, the eyes of artists, it
was evident that she was not as she had hitherto
imagined, destitute either of beauty or of attractive
charm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span></p>

<p><em>Ah! Voilà sweet Anne Page!</em> She had
grown used to the frequent exclamation when
she appeared in the garden in which at Mrs.
Burbage’s desire they were always free to come
and go as they pleased.</p>

<p>It no longer made her feel embarrassed
and uncertain as to its sincerity.</p>

<p>Her friends’ admiration for her had become
a sort of cult. She was a new type, a woman
to be praised—discreetly, with deference—yet
praised. They brought to her the incense of
a sincere flattery, and to Anne, starved of
affection<ins>,</ins> unconsciously waiting for love, it was
very sweet.</p>

<p>She accepted it humbly, gratefully, with a
surprise as great as her pleasure. But it could
not fail to produce results.</p>

<p>She began to take pains with her dress,
and her natural taste made it easy to adapt the
simple gowns she possessed, into becoming
garments. When René Dampierre exclaimed
how well something suited her, she went to the
glass and looked at herself with innocent gratification
and astonishment to find that he was
right.</p>

<p>Her eyes grew softly bright. There was
often a faint colour in her cheeks.</p>

<p>Even to the unobservant conventional bystander,
that summer Anne was charming. If

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
she scarcely recognized herself when she saw
her reflection in the glass, the change in her
mental personality still further surprised her.</p>

<p>By degrees, so slowly, so insensibly that it
seemed a natural process, she had found herself,
and in making that discovery, she had made
others.</p>

<p>These men who had seemed so strange and
wonderful at first;—beings from another planet,
whose thoughts she did not understand, whom
she watched with interested amazed eyes, became
in one sense very simple people. People
easily swayed and managed by a woman older
than themselves, a woman naturally intuitive,
but hitherto deprived of the opportunity of
exercising gifts of which she had only recently
become aware.</p>

<p>Her conversations with François Fontenelle,
as well as her previous wide reading,
had removed her ignorance of facts. The rest,
now that she was freed from the shackles of
self-mistrust, lay well within her natural powers.</p>

<p>To François Fontenelle, a quick observer,
even then a man of the world, possessed
of the keen and subtle intelligence which in
later years was to stand him in good stead for
the promotion of his material prosperity, the
change was early discernible. He viewed it
with secret amusement, and inasmuch as he

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
felt himself to a large extent responsible, some
pride, and finally a touch of uneasiness.</p>

<p>It was as though some gentle creature too
inexperienced to know its strength, had unexpectedly
without in any way losing its gentleness,
become dangerous. Dangerous to itself,
dangerous perhaps to others. He often found
himself glancing uncertainly at René, and then
reassuring himself by recalling his friend’s
natural instinctive manner to women.</p>

<p>René was always a great success with
women. His voice altered when he spoke to
them; his attentions were very charming.</p>

<p>François had heard the voice, and witnessed
the attentions many times before, and they had
never meant anything more than the sort of
thing which according to him, in the wisdom
of his sapient youth, was “all right.” The
love of a few weeks; at most, a few months.
Nothing in short that from his point of view
could affect the artist seriously, or jeopardize
his position. Why then should he feel uneasy?
Except of course, that this was a different
matter. Anne’s was not the usual case; he
could imagine no one further from the type of
woman who with <i lang='fr'>sang-froid</i> watches the departing
cavalier.</p>

<p>The idea was preposterous, ludicrous to
entertain side by side with the idea of Anne

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
Page. If Anne fell in love—heavens! if Anne
fell in love!</p>

<p>His brain almost ceased working at the
bare notion.</p>

<p>“René would be done for,” he reflected
incoherently. “I know his idiocy where
women are concerned. And if a woman like
Anne Page falls in love, there’ll be the devil
to pay! He’d have to marry her. A woman
years older than himself. And then exactions,
tears, jealousy of him, of his work. Oh awful!
Horrible!”</p>

<p>His rage at the bare possibility of such
an event extended at moments to Anne. “I
know these gentle women!” he told himself
vindictively. “They’re worse than any of
them, when it comes to a love affair. Tenacious,
determined, implacable——”</p>

<p>And then Anne would enter the drawing-room
to welcome him, or come across the
grass. Anne with her sweet gay smile, and
her gentle dignity, and his anger died.</p>

<p>It was all right, of course. What a fool
he had been! The idea had never occurred
to either of them, and all he had to do was
to keep his preposterous notions to himself.</p>

<p>Moreover, September had arrived, and the
time for the return of the whole party to Paris
was approaching.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
René certainly seemed in no hurry to
depart. But that was comprehensible.</p>

<p>He was working hard, and as François
allowed, never had he worked better. There
was a tenderness and grace in his landscapes
which was new to them, inspired he said by
the gracious beauty of Shakespeare’s county.</p>

<p>But he had finished the picture upon which
lately all his efforts had been concentrated,
and François was already urging that it was
time to go.</p>

<p>They were all in the garden one afternoon,
when the subject was first mentioned.</p>

<p>“This is delicious, charming, adorable!”
exclaimed François, suddenly looking from the
lawn across the level meadows, over which
the sun was setting. “It has been a summer
snatched out of Paradise. But we must be
getting home to our daily toil.”</p>

<p>Tea was over, but the table, laden with silver
and dainty china, had not yet been removed.</p>

<p>Anne sat near it, in a basket chair, an open
book on her knee, from which at the men’s
request she had been reading.</p>

<p>Her white muslin dress with its froth of
frills trailed on the grass.</p>

<p>The muslin fichu crossed in front and
knotted at the waist, revealed a glimpse of
her long white throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span></p>

<p>Despite himself, François glanced at her
curiously.</p>

<p>Her face was unmoved, but he fancied he
detected the faintest tremor of the frills at her
breast.</p>

<p>René was lying in a hammock slung
beneath the beech tree, and the two younger
men lay on the grass, smoking.</p>

<p>François’ remark was greeted with a
torrent of invective from them.</p>

<p>Paris be consigned to everlasting perdition!
It was still summer. Why talk of going?</p>

<p>René was silent. He raised himself in the
hammock, and with half-closed eyes, looked
at the evening fields.</p>

<p>“What a beautiful effect,” he said at last.
“Look there, where the mist is rising. I
must get that. There’s a picture.”</p>

<p>“You’ve finished your picture, <i lang='fr'>mon vieux</i>,”
returned François, speaking in French. “I
know the history of another one. You’ll mess
about, and paint out, till the snow is on the
ground. There isn’t time. No! The hour
has arrived to pack up.”</p>

<p>“We can’t leave sweet Anne Page!”
declared Dacier half seriously. He turned on
his elbow, and glanced up at her, smiling.
Without speaking, Anne returned his smile.</p>

<p>“She looks like an early Italian Madonna

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
disguised as a Reynolds portrait,” thought
François suddenly. “Why on earth has she
grown so ridiculously attractive!” was his
next irritable reflection.</p>

<p>“She must come to Paris,” declared
Thouret.</p>

<p>“But of course she must come to Paris!
When will you come, Mademoiselle Anne?
At once, won’t you? It’s a magnificent idea.
We’d take her to the Elysée Montmartre and
to the Nouvelle Athènes. Yes! And to
Versailles! Versailles in the autumn. Magnificent!
And the little streets in Montmartre,
and the Place Pigale! Seriously wouldn’t it
be splendid to show our Paris to Anne Page?”</p>

<p>They talked all together, exclaiming and
laughing, François joining them.</p>

<p>Dampierre alone said nothing. He was
still gazing over the fields, now smouldering
with faint gold, from which here and there
like incense, a ghostly mist was rising.</p>

<p>“There’s a picture there,” he repeated.</p>

<p>“Hang the picture!” exclaimed Dacier
and Thouret together. “Mademoiselle Anne
Page is coming to Paris. Aren’t you, mademoiselle?”</p>

<p>Anne shook her head. “I never go
anywhere.” She was still smiling, but François
felt a sudden pang of pity and compunction.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
To his sensitive ear, the words were an epitome
of Anne’s life.</p>

<p>When it was growing dusk, they rose, and
this evening Anne did not ask them to stay.</p>

<p>Often when it was dull, or too cold to sit
in the garden, she took them into the library,
showed them her favourite books, sometimes
read to them. Because as Dacier said, it was
good for their English accent, and she had
such a beautiful voice.</p>

<p>To-day she walked with them to the porch,
and said good-bye, in a tone that was as
friendly as ever.</p>

<p>“Tell me when you decide to go,” she said.
“We must have a picnic or something for
farewell.”</p>

<p>François turned at the gate, and saw her
standing in the porch, her dress startlingly
white in the dusk. He shrugged his shoulders,
but involuntarily the troubling sense of having
wounded some defenceless creature, returned
to him. He told himself that he was a
sentimental fool, but the illusion did not
vanish.</p>

</div>


<p><span class='smcap'>For</span> the next week, Anne saw little of her
friends.</p>

<p>The day after the suggestion for their
departure had been made, the old doctor who
attended Mrs. Burbage, asked to see her.</p>

<p>“I’m not satisfied with our patient’s
progress,” he said, closing the library door
with much precaution. “I think, Miss Page,
I should prefer to have another opinion, and
I propose writing to-night to Dr. Mears of
Harley Street.”</p>

<p>Anne listened with fear at her heart, and
the next day, the specialist arrived from
London.</p>

<p>After a lengthy visit, and a subsequent
conversation between the doctors, she was
told that the case was serious, and an operation
would probably be necessary.</p>

<p>“Write to her relatives at once,” advised
Dr. Mears, taking up his hat. “I can’t
disguise from you that there’s cause for
anxiety.”</p>

<p>Anne obeyed, and her letter was answered

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
by a telegram, announcing the arrival of Mrs.
Burbage’s nephew and his wife.</p>

<p>The intimation of their proposed visit was
received by the patient with a grim smile.</p>

<p>“Let them come if they please,” she
remarked. “I don’t propose to endure much
of their society. I shall claim the privileges of
a sick woman.”</p>

<p>They arrived the same evening; Mr.
Crosby, a weak-looking undecided man of
forty, whose thin fair hair was plastered over
a retreating forehead, and his wife, a stout
somewhat vulgar woman, arrogant and over-bearing.</p>

<p>The visit was not a success.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burbage, who once decided upon a
course of action, remained characteristically
obstinate, granted them one interview of ten
minutes, after which her door was resolutely
closed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crosby, pleading solicitude for the
relative who had always repulsed her advances,
appealed to Anne, whom she at first treated
with the superciliousness suitable to a dependent
who had without doubt acquired for her own
ends, a culpable ascendency over the old lady’s
mind.</p>

<p>Three months previously, Anne would have
been helpless in her hands; too nervous and

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
self-mistrustful to cope with a blustering
woman of the world.</p>

<p>Now, scarcely to her own surprise, so
insensibly had the change in her been wrought,
to all Mrs. Crosby’s attempted coercion, she
preserved a self-possessed opposition.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burbage did not wish to see her
nephew, or his wife.</p>

<p>That was enough. She did not see them.
After two days which exercised all Anne’s
powers of tact and self-restraint, Mrs. Crosby
returned to her Devonshire home, her husband
in tow, infuriated and baffled by the quiet
woman whose imperturbable dignity still further
roused her resentment.</p>

<p>“Mark my words Fred, that’s a designing
creature!” she exclaimed as they drove to the
station. “She behaves as though she were
mistress of the place. An ugly pale-faced
woman like that!”</p>

<p>“My dear, I don’t think her ugly exactly,
and her figure is certainly very good,” murmured
Fred, whose folly was proverbial.</p>

<p>“Ridiculous!” panted his wife. “You’re a
perfect fool, Fred! I hope your aunt won’t
leave her a farthing. It would serve her right.
Fortunately we know that the place and everything
is yours, otherwise I should leave no
stone unturned to get rid of that young person.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span></p>

<p>Anne was occupied next day with preparations
for the removal of her friend to the
nursing home in London decided upon by
the doctors. Only the nurse accompanied her.</p>

<p>“No, my dear. I refuse to have you
with me,” she said authoritatively to Anne.
“What’s the use of dragging you to town
when nurse does all I want? If they don’t
kill me between them, you shall come up
and see me afterwards. I shall want a little
change from doctors and nurses then. Just
now, you’d only be in the way.”</p>

<p>Anne drove with her to the station, and
helped to arrange her comfortably in the
invalid carriage.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, my dear,” she said rather
faintly, as Anne bent over her. She kissed
her, and with one of her rare caresses, gently
patted her hand.</p>

<p>“You’re a good girl,” she added. “If I
get well, it will only be for the pleasure of
seeing you again. You’ve got quite pretty,
Anne. I always had a weakness for pretty
people. Tell the young man, what’s his name?—René,
I’m sorry I didn’t see him.”</p>

<p>“He wanted to come to say good-bye,”
murmured Anne, trying to control her voice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burbage shook her head, and her eyes
closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span></p>

<p>“I can’t talk to young people. I’m past
it,” she whispered. “Good-bye, my dear.
God bless you.”</p>

<p>The train moved slowly out of the station,
leaving Anne on the platform, blind with tears.</p>

<p>She tried to remember that the London
doctor thought the case by no means hopeless.
In vain. She felt desolate and overwhelmed.
She was alone—and her other friends were
going too.</p>

<p>Resolutely Anne turned her mind from this
last thought. She would not tell herself that
it was because she dared not face it. They
were going next morning; and in the afternoon
they came to say good-bye.</p>

<p>Though late in the month, the day was fine
and warm, and for the last time, tea was laid
out of doors. Anne was very quiet and very
pale.</p>

<p>Dacier and Thouret commiserated with her
on the loss of her friend.</p>

<p>“But she’ll get well. It’s all right,” they
assured her cheerfully.</p>

<p>François unobserved, watched her carefully.</p>

<p>René was also very silent, and François
was grateful for the high spirits of the two
boys. They insisted before leaving, that
Anne should give them each a flower from
her Shakespeare garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span></p>

<p>The flowers of middle summer filled the
borders now.</p>

<p>“Here they are, all of them!” said François.
“Hot lavender, mints, savory, marjoram
and marigolds.”</p>

<p>“But none of you are middle-aged, so they
are not for you,” Anne returned.</p>

<p>She picked a late rose for each of them,
Dacier and Thouret receiving theirs with
extravagant delight.</p>

<p>“It shall be buried with me,” Dacier
exclaimed. “But not yet. I’ve got a few
things to do first.”</p>

<p>François groaned. “When I think of the
reams of execrable poems I’m doomed to read
before that!” he exclaimed as they strolled
under the yellowing trees. “Look here! We
must really go. I’ve got all my canvases to
pack, and so has René.”</p>

<p>“But it’s only au revoir,” declared Thouret.
“Sweet Anne Page is coming to Paris. <i lang='fr'>C’est
déjà une chose tout-à-fait entendue. Nous la
menerons entendre Sara, et Mounet-Sully dans
Hernani.</i>”</p>

<p>“We shall have her with us before the
winter sets in. And then we shall come back
next year,” added Dacier.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” returned Anne simply, shaking
hands with each of them in turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span></p>

<p>She walked back into the house when they
were gone, noticing minutely, trivial things
such as a little stain on the paint in the hall;
a flower that had fallen out of a jar on the
window ledge.</p>

<p>An hour later—when it was nearly dark,
René Dampierre found her in the rose garden.</p>

<p>She stood quite still when she saw him
coming, and waited for him to speak.</p>

<p>“I came back,” he began, stammering a
little. “The maid told me you were in the
garden. I forgot this book. You lent it to
me.”</p>

<p>He held it out to her as he spoke. It was
a little volume of Herrick.</p>

<p>“Keep it,” Anne said. “It’s mine.”</p>

<p>Her voice was steady, but her hands were
icy cold, and she was shivering.</p>

<p>He came close to her.</p>

<p>“May I? Then will you put my name
in it, as well as yours? Here’s a pencil.”</p>

<p>She rested the book on the sundial, and
bent low over it, perhaps because of the fading
light.</p>

<p>“It’s too damp for you out here, in that
thin dress,” he said in a low voice. “You’re
shivering.” He touched her hand, and she
shrank back against the sundial.</p>

<p>“Anne,” he said, still more softly, and his

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
voice trembled. “Anne, I can’t say good-bye.
Promise that you’ll come to Paris this winter.
Promise! You will, won’t you?”</p>

<p>He took both her cold hands, and suddenly
put them to his lips.</p>

<p>It was too dark to see her face, but he
heard her catch her breath, and when she
spoke, he scarcely recognized her voice.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, René. I want you to go now.
Yes, I mean it. Please go.”</p>

<p>The words, so gently spoken that he knew
he had not offended her, were full of the
authority of a woman who expects to be
obeyed. He hesitated a second, then bent
his head again, and Anne felt him kiss the
sleeve of her dress.</p>

<p>A moment later, she saw his tall figure pass
like a darker shadow, through the shadows
that hung round the gate in the wall. Long
after all the light was gone, she stood where
he had left her.</p>

<p>She knew why he had gone. Almost as
though she had been present, she knew all
the wisdom his friend François Fontenelle had
that day been pouring into his ears. She
pictured François’ cold ironical anger if he
knew, or if he came to know, of this second
farewell. Bitterest pang of all, she knew that
he was right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span></p>

<p>She stood clasping her hands together.</p>

<p>“It’s all too late—too late,” she kept repeating
unconsciously, shivering from head to foot.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Anne’s prescience was not at fault. Late
the same night, after the two younger men
had gone to their rooms, Fontenelle sat in the
parlour of the Falcon Inn, and discussed her
with his friend.</p>

<p>“You’ve been a fool, my dear fellow,” he remarked
in his dryest tone. “I warned you not
to go back. Why couldn’t you let well alone?”</p>

<p>René sprang restlessly to his feet, and stood
with his back to the fire which he had just
lighted.</p>

<p>“You know well enough. Why do you
ask absurd questions,” he returned irritably.
“It’s no use talking. I know I’m a fool. But
I can’t get her out of my head.”</p>

<p>François leant forward to tap his pipe
against the brickwork of the fireplace.</p>

<p>“You must,” he said shortly. “It’s madness.
This isn’t a case for fooling. It’s marriage—and
suicide. If it were marriage <em>or</em>
suicide you would be a wise man to choose the
latter alternative,” he added grimly.</p>

<p>René moved impatiently. “I know. I
know. You needn’t rub it in. But—she’s
adorable. I can’t forget her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span></p>

<p>François regarded him patiently. “My dear
fellow,” he said after a moment, “you may
think you’re in love, but do at least try to keep
off arrant nonsense. You know as well as I
do that you <em>will</em> forget her. That two months
after you get back, she’ll be an occasional sentimental
memory, and that a year hence, you
will never think of her at all.”</p>

<p>René laughed shortly. “You’re a detestable
brute!” he exclaimed with the half wistful
half amused smile of a spoilt child, which made
part of his charm.</p>

<p>“And the worst of it is, you’re always right.
I don’t want to marry her. I don’t want to
marry any one. I’m not the man to marry.
I’ve got work to do. You’re quite right. I
was a fool to go back.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose there was a love scene,
and a declaration of sorts?”</p>

<p>François’ voice was ironical, but there was
anxiety under the light words.</p>

<p>“No.” He grew suddenly grave. “She
asked me to go—and I went.”</p>

<p>There was a silence which lasted some
minutes. The wood fire crackled, and the
lamp illumined the comfortable room with its
fifteenth-century beams overhead, its panelled
walls and its red-covered sofa and chairs.</p>

<p>“Anne Page is not a woman to fool with,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
said François at last. He was thinking of
what she had once said, sitting in the sunshine
of the garden. “<cite>Then an artist ought to keep
out of the way of any woman who cares. But
he wouldn’t if she pleased him.</cite>”</p>

<p>The memory of the last words touched
him.</p>

<p>“She’s not made for that sort of thing.
It’s not decent. It’s not playing the game.
Leave her alone, and she’ll forget.”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, he wondered whether
he spoke truth; but that was a question to
be dismissed with a mental shrug.</p>

<p>“I dare say she’s got nothing to forget,”
returned René gloomily. “I’ve no doubt she
thinks I’m just a ridiculous young fool.”</p>

<p>François did not reply.</p>

<p>“Women are strange things,” pursued
René presently. “They alter so. Anne has
grown years younger,—and years older since
we first saw her. She manages us now. Have
you noticed?” He turned to the other man
with a quick smile. “She couldn’t have done
that at first. She was too shy, and—what’s
the word?—diffident. And yet at first, did
she seem a woman to fall in love with? I
never thought of it. I believe we all looked
upon her as an interesting creature, and thought
ourselves rather fine fellows for discovering

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
her beauty,—which perhaps doesn’t exist at
all. She was something to paint, something to
discuss——”</p>

<p>“Something to teach,” added François
slowly.</p>

<p>He glanced at the clock. “Come along!
Do you see the time? And we’ve got to
start at seven to-morrow.”</p>

<p>He got up, and put his pipe in his pocket.</p>

<p>“The art of life, my dear young friend,”
he remarked with burlesque sententiousness,
as he turned out the lamp, “is to manage
one’s episodes carefully. And to see that they
remain episodes.”</p>

<p>René did not reply. He remained seated
in the armchair, after the light was out, staring
at the still leaping fire.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XIV">XIV</h2>
</div>


<p><span class='smcap'>Three</span> days after Mrs. Burbage went away,
Anne received a telegram, summoning her at
once to London. The hours spent in travelling,
and reaching the nursing-home, passed like an
uneasy nightmare, with a background of dread
to be realized, and by the time she arrived at
the house in Wimpole Street, her friend was
unconscious.</p>

<p>She died a few minutes after Anne was
admitted to her bedside.</p>

<p>Of the time that followed, Anne had no
clear idea. She felt dazed and uncomprehending,
and when by the end of the week, she
found herself back again in the silent house
at Dymfield, it was to wonder vaguely how
she had arrived, and in what a solicitor’s
letter which awaited her, could possibly concern
her.</p>

<p>The writer, who signed himself William
Chaplin, expressed his intention of calling upon
her next day, on business.</p>

<p>Anne received him the following afternoon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
standing before the fire in the library, very
slim and tall in her black dress.</p>

<p>Instinctively she had taken refuge in this
room, as the one place unconnected with Mrs.
Burbage; the room that held no memories of
her.</p>

<p>The grey-haired man who entered, shook
hands with her rather impressively, and sat
down, with the remark that she was no doubt
acquainted with the contents of Mrs. Burbage’s
will.</p>

<p>“No,” returned Anne, “except that I
understood that everything was to go to Mr.
Crosby, her nephew.”</p>

<p>The lawyer glanced at her rather sharply.</p>

<p>“The last will is in your favour,” he replied.
“Everything is left to you unconditionally.
This house—all my client’s property—her
real and personal estate. Everything in
short.”</p>

<p>Anne turned a shade paler. She did not
understand, but she was aware that the little
grey-haired man before her, was making what
seemed to him at least, an important announcement.</p>

<p>At the end of half-an-hour’s conversation,
she followed him to the door, still unable to
grasp the significance of his words.</p>

<p>“The will, as I say, is most simple,” he

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
remarked. “Everything is quite straightforward,
and we ought to be able to get the whole
thing through speedily. In the meantime, I
congratulate you, Miss Page,” he added dryly.
“Apart from the income, Fairholme Court is
a most delightful residence.” He glanced
about him. “Most delightful,” he added.</p>

<p>Anne shook hands with him, and went
slowly back to the library.</p>

<p>Dinner was served as usual by the quiet
maids, whose demeanour since the death of
their mistress, had assumed an added shade
of decorous gravity.</p>

<p>They liked Anne, and their manner towards
her expressed a kindliness and sympathy for
which she was grateful.</p>

<p>To-night, she scarcely noticed their solicitude,
and the dishes they set before her were
taken away almost untasted.</p>

<p>She wandered into the library again after
her lonely meal, and began to pace the floor
aimlessly.</p>

<p>From time to time, she took a book from
one of the shelves, opened it, glanced at a page
that was meaningless, and unconscious of her
action, replaced the volume.</p>

<p>The dry monotonous voice of the lawyer,
re-echoed in her brain. He was saying words
which signified nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span></p>

<p>“Your income will amount to between four
and five thousand a year.”</p>

<p>Out of a mass of detail, it was only this she
remembered, and at present it conveyed nothing
to her mind.</p>

<p>She was conscious only of a feeling of loving
gratitude that her friend had cared for her. Of
what that care implied, in those first hours she
realized nothing. She could only think of her
last words at the station.</p>

<p>“If I get better, it will be for the pleasure
of seeing you again.”</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with tears as she remembered
them.</p>

<p>Gradually the hours wore on. The servants
went to bed, and the house was silent.
Mechanically Anne piled fresh logs on the
fire, and at last conscious of exhaustion from
her ceaseless pacing of the room, she sank into
a chair, and held her hands to the blaze.</p>

<p>She was a rich woman now, the lawyer had
said so.</p>

<p>What did that mean? With all her
strength Anne tried to translate the statement
into comprehensible terms.</p>

<p>First of all, it surely meant freedom from
anxiety. No weary heart-breaking toil for a
bare existence. No painful counting of hard-earned
shillings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span></p>

<p>Then,—for the first time Anne felt a
definite thrill of pleasure,—it meant the power
to help her brother. Hugh should be made
happy if money could compass it.</p>

<p>And afterwards? Well, the realization of
some of her day-dreams. She could travel.
The wonderful material world need no longer
be a mirage, a prospect viewed only by the
eye of faith and imagination. She might
become the possessor of many beautiful things.
Pictures, books, furniture, dress. She would
have the power to help people; to relieve
misery; to do some tangible good. Money
was a talisman to unlock some of the exquisite
secrets of the world.</p>

<p>Anne paused. Her thoughts, clear at last,
and swiftly moving, were suddenly arrested.</p>

<p>Her wealth might do all this, but there was
one joy it could not buy, and missing this, all
the rest, all the wonders it could work, seemed
dust and ashes. Dead Sea fruit. The time for
love was gone, and it had become the one impossible,
unattainable desire of her whole being.</p>

<p>Missing it, she would miss the meaning of
existence.</p>

<p>The pageant of the world might be revealed,
but it would be seen under the grey
skies of common day; for ever unillumined by
the light that never was on land or sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span></p>

<p>Again in her heart there rose the fierce
pain, the sickening hunger she had experienced
when for the first time in her life, she had seen
the eyes of happy lovers.</p>

<p>Swiftly in bitter mockery, her memory
placed her once more in the rose-garden,
where a week ago René had kissed her hands,
and spoken to her in the shaken voice she had
never heard from a man’s lips before.</p>

<p>If only she had been the girl to whom he
ought to have been pleading! If only she had
felt the right to say she loved him too. If
only she had been the girl she longed to be,
the wisdom of the wise would have seemed an
idle song. She would have given him her
love, freely, generously, without counting the
cost, and the future might have taken care of
itself.</p>

<p>But as it was——</p>

<p>Suddenly Anne rose to her feet. The
colour surged up into her face; the warm
blood raced through her body. She put her
trembling fingers on the mantelpiece, to steady
herself, and stood looking down into the fire.</p>

<p>As it was—why not?</p>

<p>She felt bewildered, dazed, giddy with the
thought that had come to her, as emerging
from a dark passage, one staggers in the glare
of a brilliantly lighted room. Through the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
dazzling incoherency of her idea, she clung to
one certainty.</p>

<p>If René was not in love with her as she
understood love, he was at least drawn to her
as a man is drawn irresistibly to a woman.
He had been in her hands that night. She
could have done as she pleased with him.</p>

<p>Anne knew her power at last, and deliberately,
for his sake, she had not used it.
He had gone away. He would forget, of
course—unless——Slowly she sank into
her chair, and sat thinking.</p>

<p>She thought through all her life. She
thought of the never-ending days of childhood
and youth, unlighted by any happiness, any
hope; the dreary days which had killed at last
even her dreams.</p>

<p>She thought of Hugh and his wife in a distant
colony, happy, regardless of her, unmindful,
unless she wrote to them, of her very existence.</p>

<p>She thought of the heart of despair which
she had brought back to this very room six
months ago, of the dumb certainty that life for
her had been, was, and ever would be, empty
of all gifts, of all delight. And then of the
wonderful months that had just passed. Wonderful,
because of all she had learnt of others—and
of herself.</p>

<p>She remembered the diffident shrinking

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
creature, who for shyness could scarcely lift
her eyes to the men she regarded with awe,
as dwellers in another world, whether gods or
devils she did not know.</p>

<p>She could have smiled as she thought of
them now.</p>

<p>They were neither gods nor devils, but
weak human beings like herself. Weaker
than herself, since they were young, impressionable
clay in the hands of the potter.</p>

<p>And one of them loved her.</p>

<p>She leant forward in her chair, and covered
her face with her hands.</p>

<p>A week ago, it had been an obscure penniless
woman who had found courage to arrest
an impending declaration of love.</p>

<p>To-day, the same woman,—she was rich,
her own mistress, independent, free.</p>

<p>With a wondering sense of the simplicity
of the matter, Anne saw herself at liberty to
take a step the very existence of which, till
to-night, she had not perceived.</p>

<p>She sat immovable, staring into the fire,
thinking. In the silence of the sleeping house
she looked at facts face to face, and made her
decision. Here was she, Anne Page, not only
a rich woman and her own mistress, but
practically alone in the world. Life had
hitherto offered her nothing. Now if she had

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
courage to take it, a great if brief happiness
was within her reach. She loved, and was
beloved. Too late, as she had thought. But
was it after all too late? Again Anne reflected
while the fire upon which her unseeing eyes
were fixed, leapt and sang softly to itself.
Not if she could find the further courage to
buy her happiness at a great price. To take
it while it lasted, and of her own accord relinquish
it before it had ceased to be happiness.</p>

<p>For as she thought and planned Anne saw
clearly, as only a woman who is leaving her
youth behind, can see clearly—without illusions,
with only stern facts to guide her.</p>

<p>René Dampierre was young. Naturally,
inevitably, sooner or later, he would turn to
youth for love, and she must not stand in his way.</p>

<p>But because of this, could she not even for
a little while know the joy which was every
woman’s birthright?</p>

<p>If she were willing to pay for it, why not?
Whatever happened, whatever misery was in
store, at least she paid alone. She involved
no one in her debt.</p>

<p>A cynic might have smiled at the simplicity
of her reasoning. Not one thought of her
changed circumstances entered into her reflections.
She did not consider that Anne Page the
penniless companion was a very different being

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
from Anne Page the lady of great means. To
her mind it only affected the situation in so far
that it gave her freedom; made it possible for
her to follow her own course without burdening
man, woman, or child. It was only courage
that was necessary. Courage to stake high,
and not to shrink when sooner or later the
odds should turn against her.</p>

<p>She measured her strength, and made her
decision.</p>

<p>The little clock on the mantelpiece struck
three, with a shrill silvery clamour. Anne
started, and glanced round the familiar room
with a shock of surprise, as though she had been
long away, and was astonished to find it there.</p>

<p>As she rose slowly to her feet, her reflection
in the glass above the chimney-piece also
startled her.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that for ages she had
been out of the body also.</p>

<p>She met absorbed blue eyes in a face pale
but transfigured by an inner excitement and a
great hope.</p>

<p>She saw a mouth sweet and tremulous, and
a tall figure; very graceful, really beautiful;
and suddenly she smiled.</p>

<p>“It’s not absurd. Not yet,” was the certainty
that suddenly filled her with triumphant
joy.</p>

</div>


<p><span class='smcap'>Early</span> in November, Dampierre burst one
morning into Fontenelle’s studio. They
worked in the same house in the Rue Notre
Dame des Champs, René on the top floor,
François two flights lower down.</p>

<p>He looked up as his friend came in<ins>.</ins></p>

<p>“Yes. I know. She’s coming,” he said,
without ceasing to paint. “This background’s
the very devil. It’s all wrong in tone.”</p>

<p>“How did you know?”</p>

<p>François nodded towards a side table.
“There’s her note.”</p>

<p>Dampierre found it amongst a litter of
brushes and palettes.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said glancing over it, “she says
the same thing to me. She feels she wants a
change, so she’s shut up the house for a time,
and she’ll stay in Paris possibly on her way
elsewhere. That’s all she tells me.”</p>

<p>“The old lady must have left her some
money,” observed François, still apparently
engrossed with his background. “Looks as

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
though it’s rather more than enough to keep
body and soul together, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, do shut up, and leave that damned
picture alone, and be sympathetic!” exclaimed
René, irritably.</p>

<p>His eyes were bright, and he laughed rather
excitedly.</p>

<p>“I know you’re sick she’s coming. But
I can’t stand your wisdom any longer. I’m
glad, do you hear? Glad. Glad. <em>Glad!</em>
And there’s an end of it.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, but that’s just what it’s not,”
returned Fontenelle.</p>

<p>“Very well then, it isn’t. And I don’t care.
I only know I want to see her again,—horribly.
And she’ll be here to-night, thank goodness,
and I’m going to meet her at the station.”</p>

<p>François shrugged his shoulders, and continued
to paint.</p>

<p>“Where’s her hotel? Oh, the Impérial.
She’s got that out of Baedeker.” He laughed.</p>

<p>“Come now, François. Own that sweet
Anne Page in Paris will be rather nice!”</p>

<p>“You’d better ask her to tea here to-morrow.
Your place is even more of a pig-sty than
mine. We shall see Dacier and Thouret at the
<i lang='fr'>Lilas</i> this evening. We can ask them then.”</p>

<p>“All right. But I’m not going to have
you about all the time mind!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span></p>

<p>“You won’t,” returned his friend briefly.
“I can’t stand fools.”</p>

<p>René’s face darkened for a moment, but
the retort died on his lips.</p>

<p>“Look here, old man,” he urged. “Don’t
be a beast. I’m serious.”</p>

<p>“<i lang='fr'>Tant pis</i>,” was François’ implacable reply.</p>

<p>But when next day Anne was actually in
his studio, and he heard her voice, and saw
her smile, and listened to the laughing clamour
around her, as she sat in the only armchair
that was not broken, and drank execrable tea
out of a cup which did not match its saucer, it
was difficult even for Fontenelle to be anything
but gay and pleased.</p>

<p>With an odd mixture of sensations, he
noticed how fair her skin looked against her
black dress. The fur she wore on her
shoulders was also exceedingly becoming.
François, who as a painter of many women’s
portraits knew something of the cost of feminine
apparel, looked at it with a certain
surprise. Either the old lady had been fairly
generous, or Anne in her one day’s shopping,
had been disgracefully extravagant. In either
case the result was admirable. He emerged
from his reflections to find a furious discussion
raging as to which restaurant she should be
taken to dine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span></p>

<p>“<i lang='fr'>Café de la Régence</i>,” said François
authoritatively, “and afterwards we’ll drive
back to the <i lang='fr'>Lilas</i>.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was several days before Anne found herself
alone with René.</p>

<p>He came to her hotel one morning, and
carried her off to lunch with him at a little
restaurant in the neighbourhood of his studio.</p>

<p>“You have such a devoted body-guard,
that I never get a word with you,” he complained.
“And I want you to see my pictures.
We must get in before the light goes. It gets
so confoundedly dark in the afternoons now.”</p>

<p>Later on in the great gaunt studio at the
top of the pile of buildings in the Rue Notre
Dame des Champs, Anne stood before some
of the pictures which in after years were to
fetch great sums from art collectors, which
were to be discussed by connoisseurs, to be
execrated, loved, praised, condemned, admired.</p>

<p>She did not see them. For her at the
moment, they were non-existent.</p>

<p>One thing only was in her mind; one idea,
and that in the form of a question.</p>

<p>How should she accomplish what she had
come to do?</p>

<p>This was the first time René had deliberately
sought her alone, and in the circumstance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
without malice, she divined the influence of
François Fontenelle.</p>

<p>He had meant to be careful. He had
meant to see her only in the presence of
others, but,—she knew him so well that she
could have smiled,—to-day he had thrown
prudence to the wind.</p>

<p>Tenderness was in his voice, in his eyes,
even while he kept tender words from his lips.</p>

<p>It grew dusk while she lingered. The
blue of twilight filled the windows, and a
ruddy gleam from the stove lay along the
floor. Anne sat down on the couch, and René
settled cushions at her back.</p>

<p>His hand touched her arm, and for a
moment it rested there, before he turned
abruptly away.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Anne had spoken of
returning to Dymfield.</p>

<p>“You <ins title='original: musn’t'>mustn’t</ins> go yet,” he broke out all at
once. “You won’t leave Paris yet?”</p>

<p>The words were an appeal, and his voice
was not steady.</p>

<p>“I came to see you,” said Anne deliberately.</p>

<p>He turned to her sharply. It was too dark
to see his face, but she heard the anxiety in his
tone.</p>

<p>“All of us—or me?”</p>

<p>“To see you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span></p>

<p>He threw himself on his knees beside her.
“Anne,” he whispered, “stay. I want you.
Will you marry me?”</p>

<p>He had taken her hands and was holding
them tight against his breast.</p>

<p>“No, René.”</p>

<p>The words were decisive, but she made no
effort to release herself, and her hands rested
quietly in his.</p>

<p>“Sit here, beside me,” she said, moving a
little on the couch. “I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>Wondering at something in her voice, he
obeyed in silence, and she went on speaking,
still very quietly.</p>

<p>“I won’t marry you, dear, because I’m too
old for you. I will never marry you. But if
you want me, I will stay.”</p>

<p>In his amazement, he let her hands drop,
and bent forward to see her face.</p>

<p>Quite quietly, Anne got up. “It’s very
dark,” she said. “I’ll light the candles. I
saw where you put the matches.”</p>

<p>He watched her in a sort of stupor as she
went to a side table for the matches, and
lighted one after another of the candles in a
sconce on the opposite side of the room.</p>

<p>Did she know what she had said? Had
he understood her?</p>

<p>He sat staring at her as she reached up to

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
the sconce, the movement throwing into relief
the lines of her beautiful figure.</p>

<p>When the last candle was lighted, she
turned to him smiling.</p>

<p>“No. You haven’t misunderstood me,”
she said. “Now you can see my face you will
know you have not.”</p>

<p>She came swiftly across the room, and sat
down beside him.</p>

<p>“Listen, René. I will not marry you, for
many reasons. Two months ago I was prepared
never to see you again. But things
have altered. I haven’t told you yet, but all
my circumstances have changed. I’m a rich
woman now, and my life is my own, to do
what I like with it. And because I love
you, I propose to give it to you, for a little
while at least. As long as you want me.
Until——”</p>

<p>Her voice, quite calm and quiet at first,
broke at the last words, and she paused
abruptly.</p>

<p>René sprang to his feet, and drew her
quickly up from the sofa into his arms.</p>

<p>“Anne!” he cried. “Sweet Anne Page!”
the words came brokenly between tremulous
laughter. “You don’t know what you’re saying.
You will marry me, of course, because
we love each other, because——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span></p>

<p>She put one hand on his shoulder, and so
kept him at arm’s length.</p>

<p>“I will never marry you,” she repeated.
“If you won’t consent to let me stay as I
suggest, I shall say good-bye to you now, and
I will not see you again.<del>”</del></p>

<p>“Remember René, you’re not talking to a
girl. You’re dealing with a woman who knows
her own mind, and will have this or nothing.
If I stay we both have perfect freedom. I am
old enough to do what I please with my life.
And I please to do this. René,” for the first
time the colour came to her cheeks, and her
eyes wavered, “you’ll make me shy if I have
to ask you so many times to let me stay.”</p>

<p>She looked suddenly so like a child as she
spoke, that in spite of his perplexed amazement,
Dampierre smiled.</p>

<p>He kissed her soft hair, and then her lips.
“You’re adorable,” he murmured. “But you
amazing woman, you’re an <i lang='fr'>enfant terrible</i>!
What am I to do with you?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see how simple it is?” she
asked. “I’m rich now, so I can stay as long
as you—as long as I please.” She altered the
pronoun hurriedly. “And you have plenty of
money, too, René, haven’t you? I mean that
we are each quite independent. It makes it
all so easy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span></p>

<p>He laughed again as the only expression of
his otherwise inexpressible emotions.</p>

<p>She was as guileless, as simple as a child.
Yet she was proposing——Good God, what
was she not proposing? And above all she
meant what she proposed; meant it absolutely.
He looked into her eyes, and knew that no
words of his would move her.</p>

<p>“But Anne, Anne!” he stammered.
“You’re saying awful things. Not from my
point of view, but as an Englishwoman.
<i lang='fr'>Mon Dieu!</i> as an Englishwoman with the
fear of Mrs. Grundy if not the fear of God
before her eyes!”</p>

<p>She looked at him, and his words, which
amazement and uncertainty had made flippant,
died before the sadness of her glance.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” she said. “Nobody
troubles about me. Nobody has ever
troubled. I have never been happy all my
life. And now when I could have happiness
without hurting any one, why must I give it up
because of a world in which I have no concern?”
She paused a moment, and looked at him uncertainly.</p>

<p>“You think I ought to feel I’m doing
wrong? Perhaps I ought. But I <em>don’t</em> feel
it, René. I should be doing wrong if I married
you, because——” She left the sentence

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
unfinished, forbearing to tell him that he would
some day thank her for his freedom.</p>

<p>“Don’t argue about it,” she said, smiling,
though her eyes were full of tears. “It’s my
last word. If you won’t agree, I shall go back
to Dymfield to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“No. Don’t let us waste time now, at any
rate,” he exclaimed eagerly. “We shall have
plenty of time to talk and argue. Just now
I’m too absurdly happy!”</p>

<p>He drew her down beside him on the sofa,
and covered her eyes with kisses.</p>

<p>“Anne! do you know what a sweet thing
you are? No, of course you don’t know, and
that’s what make you so delicious!”</p>

<p>Even while she thrilled from head to foot
with an almost unbearable happiness, Anne
remembered the price at which it was bought,
and told herself that it was not too dear.</p>

<p>“I only know I’m happy,” she whispered.
“But I’m afraid of waking up and finding it’s a
dream.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Again and again, through the years as
they passed, her own words came back to her.</p>

<p>In the summer evenings at Dymfield, she
thought of them. When she travelled, they
often came to her as she stood before some
picture in church or gallery. She thought of

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
them sometimes at night, when on some Italian
terrace she sat watching the sunset.</p>

<p>To-day she remembered them, as she
walked home through the sunshine, and
mounted the stately Spanish steps towards
her apartment on the heights.</p>

<p>“Twenty years ago!” She repeated the
words to herself in wonder.</p>

<p>“It was a beautiful dream, and thank God,
I never waked.”</p>

</div>


<p><span class='smcap'>Dr. Dakin</span> was spending the night in town
on his way to Paris.</p>

<p>For the previous fortnight, urged not so
much by the impressive hints concerning his
duty thrown out by Mrs. Carfax, as by a
curious change in his wife’s letters to him, he
had been on thorns of impatience to join her
in Paris, and bring her home.</p>

<p>The serious illness of a patient, an exasperating
case which always seemed on the point
of mending, only to sink into another relapse,
kept him prisoner.</p>

<p>Not till the previous day had he considered
it safe to telegraph for the doctor he had
engaged to look after his practice during his
own absence, and a still further delay had
been occasioned by the necessity of meeting
this man in London to explain the peculiar
nature of the case under treatment.</p>

<p>Leaving his hotel in the evening, he
walked westward in search of a place to
dine, meditating in a troubled fashion as he

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
walked. His wife had been away more than
three months, and he had made no effort to
recall her. The visit, accepted ostensibly at
least, partly on the ground of her health, was
in any case to have been a long one. Then
followed the plea of the cure which a certain
well-known physician had prescribed, and
again her husband had agreed to her wishes.
He told himself to be patient. After his talk
with Miss Page, he had been full of hope. But
it would not do to annoy Madge by bringing
her home again before she wished to come.
It would be wiser to let her tire of Paris, and
then when she returned, he would take the
advice of a wise and charming woman, and
perhaps there might yet be happiness for
Madge,—and for him too.</p>

<p>So he had waited, forcing himself to self-control
through his hourly longing for her.</p>

<p>At first, for many weeks, her letters were
discouraging;—hurried and indifferent. She
was enjoying Paris. She felt better, or not so
well. They were the letters of a woman who
writes perfunctorily, from a sense of duty.
Quite lately they had altered, and though the
change in them filled him with delight, it
was joy mingled with uneasiness. They were
hysterical letters, composed of vague self-reproaches
about her selfish neglect of him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
mingled with terms of endearment, and assertions
of her own unworthiness.</p>

<p>Fatal letters to write to a man who possessed
a trace of cynicism, or of what is
commonly called knowledge of the world, but
to the simple mind of her husband, they
suggested only alarming fears for her bodily
health. He must go and fetch her home
immediately. Poor little Madge! In the
midst of his anxiety, he was not insensible
of a thrill of joy at the thought that from
whatever cause, her heart had turned to him.</p>

<p>With this thought in his mind, he again
dismissed as an impertinence, a letter he had
lately read containing more than a hint that
his wife’s protracted stay in Paris was due to
a certain bad influence exercised upon her in
the past.</p>

<p>He had never considered the matter
seriously, yet as he entered the dining-room a
moment later, the whole circumstance of the
letter and its accusation, was recalled by the
sight of a face he remembered.</p>

<p>He had turned into a restaurant in the
Haymarket, to which on their rare visits to
town, he had once taken Madge to dine.</p>

<p>With the sentimental idea at which he
scarcely smiled, of finding the exact place
they had on that occasion occupied, he

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
went upstairs, and was glad to find the table
in the corner disengaged. He had given his
order to the waiter, before seated at some little
distance across the room, he saw the man he
recognized.</p>

<p>For the moment he was puzzled, then like
a flash came the memory of a dinner party at
Fairholme Court six months ago, and with it
in a flood the further memory of other things
he had for the moment forgotten.</p>

<p>Monsieur Fontenelle apparently did not see
him, but apart from the fact that he had liked
him, Dr. Dakin was quite determined to recall
their previous meeting to his consciousness.</p>

<p>Madge had sometimes mentioned him in
letters. If he had recently come from Paris,
he would have news of her. He left his place
and crossed to his neighbour’s table, with
outstretched hand.</p>

<p>“We met at a very pleasant little dinner at
Fairholme Court, some months ago,” he began.
“My name is Dakin. I expect you’ve forgotten
it. Yours is a name one can’t forget.”</p>

<p>Fontenelle gave him a hasty glance; then
took the hand he offered, with a charming
smile.</p>

<p>“But of course! When Miss Page was
our hostess. Have you heard from her lately?
I am told she is coming back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span></p>

<p>“Won’t you come to my table, as we have
neither of us begun to feed?” suggested Dr.
Dakin. “It’s quieter there. Out of the
draught.”</p>

<p>“Delighted!” François assured him.</p>

<p>The change was effected.</p>

<p>“I can give you the latest news of your
wife,” he said almost before he was seated.
“I saw her only yesterday. I called in fact to
make my farewells.”</p>

<p>“How is she?” inquired the doctor
anxiously. It was the one question that concerned
him.</p>

<p>“Not altogether well, I fancy. A little
homesick. Paris possibly a little on her
nerves.”</p>

<p>He took up the wine list. “Can we agree
as to wine?”</p>

<p>The doctor made a hasty gesture. “Anything
you like. I’m on my way to bring her
home,” he observed.</p>

<p>Fontenelle, who was giving the waiter
elaborate directions about warming the Burgundy
he had selected, did not at once reply.</p>

<p>When the man had hurried off with a <i lang='fr'>Bien
Monsieur!</i> he looked at his companion.</p>

<p>“You are going to fetch her you say?
Good! I think all she wants is the rest and
quiet of your charming village. Paris is not

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
the place for nervous women, doctor. The
atmosphere is too exciting—too distracting.”
He made a little comprehensive gesture with
both hands.</p>

<p>“But you don’t think she’s ill?”</p>

<p>In spite of himself, in spite of his British
horror of displaying emotion, the doctor’s voice
shook a little.</p>

<p>“<i lang='fr'>Mais non! Mais non. Rien de tout</i>,”
returned his companion, with a reassuring
smile. “Madame is suffering a little from
her ‘cure.’ That is only to be expected.
Pardon!” he laughed genially. “For the
moment I forgot I was not speaking to a
layman.”</p>

<p>The doctor laughed also, and tried to forget
that the mere mention of his wife’s name had
set his heart beating.</p>

<p>He applied himself to his dinner.</p>

<p>“Did I understand that you’re going to
leave Paris for long?” he asked. “I think
you said you had been to say good-bye to
Madge—to my wife?”</p>

<p>“I’m really uncertain,” returned François,
regarding him with keen smiling eyes. “I’m
over here on business connected with the
exhibition to which your countrymen with
more politeness than discretion have elected
me President. After that?” He shrugged

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
his shoulders with a characteristic gesture.
“I don’t know. A journey to Egypt, perhaps.
But that depends on circumstances.
Did I tell you that Miss Page is coming
home? She may even be in Paris by this
time. Mrs. Dakin is evidently looking forward
to seeing her.”</p>

<p>For a moment the doctor was silent.</p>

<p>“Miss Page is an old friend of yours—a
great friend?” he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“I think I may say my best and dearest
friend.”</p>

<p>At the mention of Anne’s name an imperceptible
change crept into his manner. An
undercurrent of irony, too subtle for his companion’s
apprehension, vanished from his voice
and from his words, which were grave and
deliberate.</p>

<p>“I might with truth repeat what you have
said,” returned the doctor slowly.</p>

<p>He took up his knife and fork, and absently
replaced them on his plate, into which he
stared, as though lost in thought.</p>

<p>“And so,” said François, watching him,
“you are naturally indignant about a certain
story——”</p>

<p>The other man looked up quickly.</p>

<p>“I know all about it,” Fontenelle went
on. “Madame Didier, who belongs to a

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
certain feminine type indigenous to every
country, has worked with great industry, and
Fortune has favoured her. During her visit
to England, she came across a certain Mrs.
Crosby, the wife of old Mrs. Burbage’s
nephew.”</p>

<p>He paused, and critically tasted the wine
which the waiter had just poured into his
glass.</p>

<p>“<i lang='fr'>Bon!</i>” he exclaimed appreciatively.</p>

<p>“This woman,” he continued, “convinced
that her husband’s inheritance was stolen from
him by our friend, naturally paints her in the
glaring colours of an adventuress.”</p>

<p>Both men smiled.</p>

<p>“The character suits Anne Page, doesn’t
it? At any rate it suited Madame Didier,
who with unfailing resource has patiently unearthed
the story of twenty years ago. This
story, I understand, she has lost no time in
communicating to the wife of the vicar of
your idyllic village, whence having reached
the fountain head, I imagine it is flowing
in refreshing streams through the entire
county?”</p>

<p>“No,” returned the doctor quickly. “The
vicar, whatever qualities he may lack, happens
to be a gentleman, and is moreover one of
Miss Page’s many friends. Fortunately this

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
woman, Madame Didier, wrote to him, not to
Mrs. Carfax, and as the letter to some extent
concerned my wife, he brought it to me.”</p>

<p>Fontenelle gently raised his eyebrows, but
refrained from comment.</p>

<p>“The vicar,” Dr. Dakin went on with a
half smile, “is filled with righteous indignation
about what he naturally believes an impudent
lie. He has written to his correspondent,
threatening pains and penalties if she communicates
with his wife, or tries in any way
to spread the scandal. He’s a wise man,” he
added dryly. “Mrs. Carfax is not the woman
to be trusted with the reputation of her dearest
friends.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence.</p>

<p>“I didn’t tell him,” continued the doctor,
“that I had previously heard the story from
my wife, who assures me it is true.”</p>

<p>François’s expression was inscrutable.</p>

<p>“And—pardon me—you, I imagine, regard
the matter as, well let us say as an Englishman?”</p>

<p>“If as I suppose I am to understand, you
mean that I’m naturally a hypocrite,” returned
the doctor rather stiffly, “you are mistaken.
Miss Page is the best, the most generous
woman I have ever met. Whatever her life
may have been, that is the result. The rest
doesn’t concern me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span></p>

<p>A sudden light sprang into the other man’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said simply, in a
tone of sincerity.</p>

<p>He looked round the room which was
now hot, crowded, and noisy with the clink
of glasses, and the babel of talk.</p>

<p>“Have you anything to do this evening?
If not, will you come round to my club where
we can smoke in peace?”</p>

<p>“I should like nothing better,” returned
Dr. Dakin.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVII">XVII</h2>
</div>


<p>“<span class='smcap'>I’m</span> going to tell you the story of Anne Page
as I know it,” said Fontenelle, as they sat in
a corner of the almost deserted smoking-room.
“You may hear all sorts of versions,
and I should like you to listen now to the true
one.”</p>

<p>He smiled, as he lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>“You<ins>,</ins> also, are a student of psychology,
doctor, and it has always seemed to me that
Anne Page is a singularly interesting study.</p>

<p>“Nowadays in this age of modern thought,
perhaps I should rather say in this age of fads
and cranks, through which men and women
are groping towards a different conception of
life, her conduct would not have been so
amazing.</p>

<p>“If she had been a modern woman, filled
with the latest ideas of the sanctity of passion,
whatever that may mean; the duty of leading
her own life, and so forth, one might class her
with a number of earnest feminine enthusiasts
whose brains, like the old bottles of Scripture,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
are unequal to the strain of the new wine of
recent ideas.”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t fit in <em>there</em>,” returned the doctor,
smiling.</p>

<p>“Think of it!” exclaimed François with
sudden animation. “A simple gentle woman
of twenty years ago. A woman who had led
the narrowest of lives; ignorant of men;
ignorant of passion—till at the age of thirty-seven
she falls in love, and is loved by a man
ten years younger than herself. And that man,
René Dampierre.”</p>

<p>The doctor started. “You mean the
painter?”</p>

<p>François nodded. “She was his mistress
for three years.”</p>

<p>Both men smoked in silence for a few
moments.</p>

<p>“One might have guessed,” said the doctor
quietly, “that she would choose a lover worthy
of her.”</p>

<p>“Anne is an unconscious artist,” returned
Fontenelle. “It was the most beautiful love
affair I have ever known. The only perfect
one—thanks to her courage and self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>“Anne is a simple woman in the sense that
all her emotions are unsophisticated, original,
generous. But she is also the wisest woman I
ever met.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span></p>

<p>“She knew René better than he knew
himself. That is to say, she knew men—or
rather divined their natures, by her sixth sense
of intuition.</p>

<p>“She might have married him. He wanted
to marry her. But she knew what the result
would be.</p>

<p>“Oh, René was not a brute,” he exclaimed
in answer to his companion’s sudden movement.
“Far from it. Except for his genius,
he was the average kindly natured man. But
Anne very wisely took his genius into account.
He was not the man to marry, and she knew
it. She is proud, as only a woman of her type
can be proud. And then—here felt the artist
in life—this was her first and last passion, the
only vital emotion she had ever experienced
in an existence otherwise incredibly grey, incredibly
monotonous. She wanted to make
it a perfect memory for herself, as well as for
him.”</p>

<p>He paused a moment, throwing back his
head against the padded chair, while he
watched the rings of smoke he was blowing.</p>

<p>“And so,” he went on presently, “she made
a resolve which few women would have found
the courage either to make, or what is more
important—to keep. She determined to stay
with him only while his first passion lasted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
She made up her mind to go even before the
first cloud was in the sky,—at any rate before
it was visible to <em>him</em>. Women have keener
eyes than men for rising clouds.”</p>

<p>The doctor was silent. “Rightly or
wrongly,” he went on, “she felt that only in
this way, only by running no risk of injuring
either him or his career, she was justified in
taking her little measure of happiness. She
knew him very well,” he added meditatively.
“René was as weak as most of us, weaker
than some perhaps, where women are concerned.
He would have been unfaithful, but
he could never take his unfaithfulness callously.
He would have been torn perpetually between
his desires, and his dread of hurting her. And
his work would have suffered terribly. Anne
was right to go.”</p>

<p>“You speak as an artist,” remarked the
doctor drily.</p>

<p>“I can speak in no other way,” returned
François. “René Dampierre was a great
man with a definite work to do.”</p>

<p>“But Dampierre,—René Dampierre?”
The doctor uttered the name with respect.
“He must have died soon afterwards, surely?”</p>

<p>“Eighteen months afterwards. But not,
I regret to tell you, of a broken heart.”</p>

<p>François placed the end of his cigarette

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
in the ash-tray before him, and ground it to
powder. His smile was a curious blend of
sadness and irony.</p>

<p>“It was an accident, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The result of a fall from his horse.
He was riding at Chantilly.”</p>

<p>“And you mean that——?”</p>

<p>“That Anne was right to go. She knew
the woman before René himself guessed the
truth. She suffered I know, or perhaps as
I <em>don’t</em> know. But not so horribly, I think,
as they would both have suffered if she had
stayed. And she made her exit with dignity.”
He smiled again. “I am a Frenchman, doctor,
and I suppose the love of <i lang='fr'>le beau geste</i> is in
my blood. I take off my hat to Anne Page.”</p>

<p>When Dr. Dakin spoke, it was in a voice
from which he could not banish indignation.</p>

<p>“It seems incredible! That he could forget
a woman like that, I mean.”</p>

<p>His own faithful nature rose up in revolt
at the outrage to all his sentiments of enduring
love.</p>

<p>“He didn’t,” returned François quickly.
“Anne had no real rival. She may rest in
peace. Fate was kind to her—and perhaps
to him,” he added. “Their love while it
lasted, was perfect, and death settled the
future. You are thinking that if any woman

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
was worthy of fidelity it was Anne Page? I
agree with you. But when a woman late in
life falls in love with a genius——” he made
a gesture with his hand, and left the sentence
unfinished.</p>

<p>“Tragic, doctor, I admit. But it’s life,—and
Anne knew and accepted it.”</p>

<p>The faint irony which he could seldom
keep out of his voice, was almost submerged
by something that sounded like real emotion.</p>

<p>“You knew them both very well, of
course?” asked Dr. Dakin, after quite a long
silence. “When they were together, I mean.”</p>

<p>“I was with them nearly every evening,
when they entertained all the men best worth
knowing, in Paris<ins>.</ins> It must have struck you
that Anne is a woman of unusual mental
distinction?”</p>

<p>“She is a very brilliant woman.”</p>

<p>“That is easily discernible when, as with
you, she has a chance of real conversation.
She has naturally a keen quick mind, and
she learnt to talk in a very admirable school.</p>

<p>“The evenings at the flat in the Rue de
Fleurus are still remembered in Paris.”</p>

<p>He smiled to himself, as though in
thought he had gone back to those evenings.</p>

<p>“I wish I could put before you doctor, the
charm of their home life. There has been

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
nothing like it since. That sounds terribly
middle-aged, doesn’t it? I realize that I’m
growing old, when I think of the society of
twenty years ago, as incredibly brilliant and
fascinating.</p>

<p>“At any rate it was composed of the men
and women who have since made their mark
on our age. They are well known names, at
any rate to a man like you who interests himself
in our countrymen as well as in your own.</p>

<p>“Among the painters there were Giroux,
and Bussières, and Deslon. All men associated
with the Impressionist movement. Thouret
the novelist, and Dacier the poet, were
intimate friends. They met Anne first at
Fairholme Court, with me, and they were
always devoted to her. Then there was
Matignon the critic, a fine old man, who
adored her. And Bellet, and Courtois—I
could go on quoting indefinitely. They had
a flat in the Rue de Fleurus, beautiful as
only Anne knows how to make a home
beautiful. It overlooked the Luxembourg
gardens, and was close to my present studio.
I remember it always full of sunshine, and
I can see Anne arranging the flowers, (every
room was full of flowers), and looking up
from them to laugh.</p>

<p>“She was so radiantly happy it was a joy to

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
see her. And she grew so beautiful. She
learnt to dress, of course. Beautiful dress is
one of her instincts, as you see even now.
What a hostess she was! She became the
fashion in our set,—René’s and mine. The
men raved about her. They found <i lang='fr'>piquante</i>,
that touch of English shyness and modesty
which she combines so oddly with dignity.
She held a real salon, and a very brilliant
one too, in the Rue de Fleurus. Those were
her <i lang='fr'>beaux jours</i>.”</p>

<p>“I can imagine it,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>“That sort of <i lang='fr'>ménage</i> is only possible in
Paris,” observed François. “Even there, it’s
not without its difficulties. But she surmounted
them by her very unconsciousness
and simplicity. Some of the women even,
were won over. One or two of the wives of
men in René’s circle were her intimate friends.
They went to her as we all did, for advice and
sympathy.”</p>

<p>“Just as we all go now to be consoled,”
put in Dr. Dakin.</p>

<p>“Precisely. And one of the secrets of her
power of drawing confidence, is that Anne is by
nature a maternal woman—a mother.”</p>

<p>“That’s the pity of it.”</p>

<p>“I agree. Life hasn’t given her everything.
But at least it gave her three

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
unforgetable years, and a memory which has
kept her sweet and fresh and young as in her
girlhood she could never have been.”</p>

<p>“And she went away,” said the doctor
gently, “in the midst of her happiness?”</p>

<p>“She went away quietly, simply, with no
fuss, as she does everything. With no farewell
scene, or anything of that sort. She left
him a letter, and with me, a message. The
hardest I ever had to deliver in my life.”</p>

<p>Fontenelle got up, and threw the end of
his cigarette into the fire.</p>

<p>“And then she travelled?”</p>

<p>“For years. When they were together,
she and Dampierre went to Italy every spring.
I believe she has gone over all the old ground
since then. She seems to have gone half over
Europe as well. I used to get letters from
Athens, from Constantinople, from Naples,
Rome, Florence. Fortunately she was a rich
woman, able to work off her restlessness.”</p>

<p>He laughed a little. “That was one of
her adorable simplicities. It never occurred
to her that the possession of a fortune made
any difference to the situation. She only
looked upon it as a means of independence and
freedom when her happiness should come to
an end. And she was right. René never
thought of it either. In some ways he was as

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
childlike and as unworldly a creature as she.
He had inherited a fairly good income from his
father. He would not have known what to do
with more. That’s Anne Page’s story, doctor.
I don’t know how it strikes an Englishman,
but to me it seems rather a wonderful one
because of the type of woman to whom it
belongs.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Dr. Dakin meditatively.
“One would have thought that convention, or
religious prejudice——”</p>

<p>Fontenelle laughed. “She is untouched
by either. <i lang='fr'>C’est un vrai caractère, cette chère
Anne Page!</i> Until she came to Paris, she
hadn’t mixed enough with the world even to
<em>know</em> its conventions. Religion? Well, ‘by
their fruits ye shall know them,’ and if the
fruits of the Spirit are faith and hope, and
the charity which suffers long and is kind,
there never was a woman who has more
absolutely attained the results of religion. It’s
not a satisfactory result for the moralist, I
admit,” he added.</p>

<p>“But in this very interesting and amazing
world, the moralists don’t have it all their own
way,” observed the doctor.</p>

<p>“So far as creeds and dogmas are concerned,
Anne is a born pagan. It is not
that she has examined and rejected them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
They simply don’t appeal to her nature. When
as young men we first met her, we called her
<cite>Flora</cite>, amongst ourselves. She struck us
even then as a curious blend of Madonna and
goddess. And the physical appearance has
a mental and moral parallel. I remember
once when I wanted to tease her, I asked what
had become of her religion.</p>

<p>“She looked at me with those childlike eyes
of hers and said:</p>

<p>“‘I never had any,—in the sense you
mean. By being with René I’m not hurting
any one. And it’s only by hurting people one
does wrong.’</p>

<p>“Then—I admit it was cruel of me, but
I was curious—I said that some people had
refrained from doing what she had done, for
the sake of example to humanity. Her reply
was ‘But apart from religion, people haven’t
yet decided what <em>is</em> the right way to arrange
their lives.’”</p>

<p>Dr. Dakin smiled. “In view of the modern
ferment of opinion, she was right there.”</p>

<p>François pushed his chair back, with a
movement of impatience.</p>

<p>“Well now what’s to be done? The tale
of her incredibly evil past will spread I suppose,
and Dymfield will become impossible.”</p>

<p>He laughed rather savagely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span></p>

<p>“It’s quite an amusing notion that scandal
should attack a gentle woman of Anne’s age.
Yet I imagine that few of the natives of a
village possess a sense of humour.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think the story will spread. The
vicar as I told you is absolutely incredulous,
and no one else has heard it.”</p>

<p>“Except Madame?” hinted François. “I
don’t wish to suggest an unkindness. But
women, you understand? A whisper to a
dear friend—<i lang='fr'>hein</i>?”</p>

<p>“My wife is devoted to Miss Page,” said
the doctor shortly. “I shall warn her; but
she will be indignant at the mere suggestion of
betrayal.”</p>

<p>“<i lang='fr'>Parfaitement!</i>” returned François with a
bow. “Pardon me. You will probably find
Miss Page in Paris,” he added. “She was
expected to-day.”</p>

<p>“So much the better. It will be a great
pleasure.”</p>

<p>The doctor rose. “Good-night,” he said,
extending his hand cordially. “And thank you
for this talk. Perhaps if you decide not to go
to Egypt, you will do us the honour of staying
with us a little later, when my wife comes back?
Our friendship for Miss Page makes a bond
between us,” he added, in his pleasant sincere
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span></p>

<p>François met his eyes for an instant. They
were full of the kindliness and instinctive liking
he felt for the man he was addressing.</p>

<p>“A thousand thanks. But I think I am
almost certain to go to Egypt.”</p>

<p>“Another time then. I shall only say
<i lang='fr'>au revoir</i>.”</p>

<p>François followed him into the hall, and
watched him step into a hansom, and give the
address of his hotel to the driver.</p>

<p>When he turned away, there was a curious
expression about his lips, which presently
deepened into a smile that was partly cynicism,
partly something else.</p>

<p>He was reflecting on the curious encounters
liable to befall a man like himself. He thought
of the evening’s conversation, and smiled again
to think how completely till this moment he
had failed to realize the humour of its friendly
nature.</p>

<p>“<i lang='fr'>C’est un honnête homme. Il ne méritait
pas ça——</i>”</p>

<p>François dismissed the subject of Dr.
Dakin’s deserts with a mental shrug, as he
went upstairs to his room, in which a bright
fire was burning.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVIII">XVIII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class='smcap'>François</span> drew up an armchair close to the
blaze, and lighted his pipe.</p>

<p>His thoughts at first dwelt upon the man
with whom he had just parted—a loyal
straight, good fellow if ever there was one, he
decided. The verdict was accompanied by a
greater sense of self-dissatisfaction, a sensation
nearer to shame and regret that he had for
years experienced.</p>

<p>It was an uncomfortable attitude of mind,
and with characteristic love of ease, he
hastened to obliterate it, by turning his attention
elsewhere.</p>

<p>His conversation with the doctor had
conjured up so many mental pictures of the
past, that he scarcely knew which of them
to examine first.</p>

<p>The salon in Anne Page’s flat, rose before
him. With the retentive memory of a painter,
François recalled minutely every detail of the
charming room.</p>

<p>He saw the deep-red curtains drawn across

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
the three windows, the rose-coloured carpet,
the lights shining like stars between the flowers.
He saw Anne standing near the table at which
coffee was served, receiving her guests with
her lovely smile, and eager words of welcome.</p>

<p>He remembered to the smallest detail of
lace and trimming, a dress she often wore in
the evening, a gown of purple silk which suited
so admirably, her hair and the soft whiteness
of her neck.</p>

<p>Giroux and Bussières were talking to her,
and he watched with amusement their excited
faces, and vehement gestures.</p>

<p>It was the evening after René had shown
his new pictures.</p>

<p>There had been a crowd of his friends in
the studio all the afternoon; a crowd of eager
interested men and women, standing before
the canvases now so well known, so greatly
prized.</p>

<p>Bussières and Giroux he knew were talking
of the latest picture, his masterpiece—the
famous picture of the lady in the green dress,
leaning back upon the sofa.</p>

<p>François looked round the room already
filled with people.</p>

<p>He saw the white head of Matignon the
critic, towering above the rest. He saw the
dark alert face of Thouret bent towards

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
Madame Valory, the painter of pastels delicate
and fragile as herself. He saw Courtois
the sculptor, in animated discussion with Bellet
the new poet of audacities in rhythm. He
heard René’s sudden amused laugh, and turned
to look at him, as he moved from one group
to the other, a little flushed and excited, his
fair hair ruffled, his slim yet athletic figure
suggesting the Englishman of sport and open-air
pastimes, rather than the brilliant French
painter he had even then become.</p>

<p>Conspicuous among the crowd was the
lady whose portrait he had recently painted.</p>

<p>Blanche Aubriot was the wife of an elderly
<i lang='fr'>roué</i>, who regarded her very pronounced
flirtations with an indifference equal to that
which she on her side extended towards his
infidelities.</p>

<p>She was a beautiful young woman of two
or three and twenty, childless, soulless, and
much admired.</p>

<p>To-night she wore the green dress of the
picture, and held her court with her usual
piquante vivacity.</p>

<p>François regarding the scene with critical
and observant eyes, noticed how frequently
her glance wandered in René’s direction, and
with amusement, her oft-repeated efforts to
attract his attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span></p>

<p>His own eyes turned again to Anne, where
she stood surrounded by friends, laughing and
talking.</p>

<p>He watched her to-night with peculiar
admiration.</p>

<p>Curiously enough Dampierre had never
painted her.</p>

<p>Once soon after they had settled in their
apartment, François had spoken of it as a
foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>“She’s just your type—the essentially
feminine type of woman.”</p>

<p>Greatly to his surprise, René shook his
head.</p>

<p>“<i lang='fr'>C’est impossible</i>,” he said conclusively.</p>

<p>François wondered, but the conversation
turned immediately upon other matters, and
it was only just before he took leave, when
Anne was out of the room, that his friend
took a book from one of the shelves, and
turning over the leaves, handed it to him at
an open page.</p>

<p>“That’s why I can’t paint her,” he said.</p>

<p>The poem he touched with his forefinger
was Browning’s song beginning—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentdq">“<cite>Nay, but you who do not love her,</cite></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><cite>Is she not pure gold, my mistress?</cite>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>François read it aloud, and came to the last
few lines—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentdq">“<cite>Then why not witness, calmly gazing,</cite></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><cite>If earth holds aught—speak truth—above her?</cite></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><cite>Above this tress, and this, I touch</cite></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><cite>But cannot praise, I love so much!</cite>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“For <em>praise</em>, read <em>paint</em>,” said René, taking
the book and closing it. “It’s the same thing.
You’re the man to paint her. Ask her to sit
for you.”</p>

<p>François had always delayed to avail himself
of the suggestion.</p>

<p>To-night he determined to delay no longer.
Crossing the room, he joined the little group
round Anne, and presently drew her away.</p>

<p>“I haven’t had a word with you this evening,”
he said. “And now you must give me
one, or even two. About that portrait. I think
the time has come. When will you sit for me?”</p>

<p>Even at the moment, he was struck by the
curious expression which crossed her face.</p>

<p>When afterwards he tried to analyze it, he
could only think of the face of a woman who
expecting a signal of some sort, had heard, and
accepted it.</p>

<p>“When would you like me to come?” she
asked.</p>

<p>She was standing at the end of the room by
the fire, and as she raised her eyes, François
saw in them the look which did not escape
him when he came to paint them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span></p>

<p>They discussed the matter for a few
moments. Various engagements on both sides
postponed the first sitting for a fortnight, but
a day was finally arranged.</p>

<p>“How long will it take?” asked Anne.</p>

<p>He made a gesture of ignorance. “I don’t
know. A month perhaps, with luck. But this
is going to be my masterpiece, Anne. I shall
succeed, or perish in the attempt. Have you
got that flowered gown you used to wear in
the garden at Dymfield? I suppose not. Yes?
<i lang='fr'>Très bien!</i> Bring it, I want to try an effect.”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by René, who came up
at the moment, and laid his hand lightly on
Anne’s arm.</p>

<p>“I want you to go and talk to Matignon,
dear,” he said in a low voice. “He’s always
bad tempered if you don’t pay him enough
attention. Go and make love to the old boy.”</p>

<p>A vague uneasiness passed from François’s
mind at the sound of his friend’s voice, always
gentle when he spoke to Anne. It was even
gentler than usual now, and he did not fail to
notice the caress of his hand on her sleeve,
nor the look of happy understanding between
them, as she moved away, smiling, to obey him.</p>

<p>“I’m arranging for her to come and pose.
I’m going to begin the picture at once,” he
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span></p>

<p>“<i lang='fr'>Bon!</i>” returned René, his face lighting
up. “You’ve taken your time about it.”</p>

<p>“One hesitates to begin one’s masterpiece,”
François retorted. “You who do nothing else,
except finish them, ought to have compassion
on the weaker brethren.”</p>

<p>René made a laughing gesture of menace.</p>

<p>“<i lang='fr'>Allons, mes amis ... mais calmez-vous
donc!</i>” exclaimed Blanche Aubriot at his
elbow.</p>

<p>François looked down at her white
shoulders, and experienced a momentary feeling
of repugnance which passed into self-ridicule,
for glancing at her indolent brown eyes soft
as velvet, at her full red lips, at her glossy
hair, he acknowledged her beauty.</p>

<p>“Come and talk to me, Monsieur René,”
she urged with the insistence of a spoilt
child. “You’re a great man, I know, but the
lion condescends to the mouse sometimes,
doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>François followed them with his eyes as
they moved away together.</p>

<p>“If she had said <em>cat</em>, I should have found
no difficulty in reversing the parts,” was his
inward reflection.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The fire had died down, but as he sat
before the smouldering ashes, François was

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
very far in space and time from the club bedroom
in which he was dreaming.</p>

<p>He was passing through successive stages
of satisfaction and despair, hope and baffling
discouragement, while he painted Anne’s portrait.
After the first fortnight, she came every
day, and every day she was more silent.</p>

<p>He remembered this afterwards. At the
time, engrossed heart and soul in his picture, he
did not notice her quietude. He was only half
consciously perplexed by a subtle difference in
her expression which he found hard to reconcile
with his previous impression of her—a difference
which was at once his inspiration, and
his despair.</p>

<p>“If only I can get that, I shall paint a
great picture!” he exclaimed one day involuntarily,
breaking a long silence.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Anne.</p>

<p>He started, forgetting that he had spoken
aloud.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>She smiled a little. “Then I’m afraid you
won’t get it.”</p>

<p>“But I <em>have</em>!”</p>

<p>He almost shouted the words, one afternoon
a week afterwards, when she had stood
patiently almost as long as the daylight
lasted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span></p>

<p>She looked at him with inquiring eyes, as
he threw down his brush.</p>

<p>“I won’t touch it again! It’s there! It’s
all right. <i lang='fr'>Mon Dieu!</i> Anne, do you hear
me? I’ve painted a great picture.”</p>

<p>He came towards the stand, both hands
outstretched, and helped her down.</p>

<p>“Come and look before the light goes,”
he urged. “Why Anne——” his triumphant
tone changed abruptly to consternation.
“You’re not ill, dear? You’re trembling so.
What a brute I am! I’ve kept you posing
too long. I forgot. Come and sit in this
chair. Here’s a cushion. I’ll get you some
water.”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “I’m all right,” she
assured him, trying to smile. “I want to see
the picture.”</p>

<p>He turned the easel towards her, and she
looked at it a long time in silence.</p>

<p>“Do you like it?” asked François at last
anxiously.</p>

<p>“It’s too good for me. It’s idealized,” she
said. “But it’s the best thing you’ve ever
done, François. I congratulate you. You’re
right. It’s your masterpiece.”</p>

<p>He felt a warm glow of pleasure. Anne as
he had often acknowledged was an admirable
critic, instinctively a connoisseur, and her life

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
amongst painters had trained and sharpened
her natural perception. Secretly François
stood in greater awe of Anne’s verdict on
his work, than on that of many of his fellow-craftsmen.</p>

<p>“You have suggested all the Dymfield
garden in those flowers,” she said after another
silence.</p>

<p>“In you,” he returned quickly, wondering
at the tone in her voice.</p>

<p>“I’m going to give you this, Anne,” he
went on, speaking gaily to avert an uneasy
fear. “I hope you appreciate the compliment.
I lay my masterpiece at your feet, and you can
pick it up and hang it in your salon, between
the two long windows. That’s the place for it.”</p>

<p>She turned slowly from the picture, and
her eyes met his, while she shook her head.</p>

<p>“No,” said she in a low voice. “I can’t
take it, François.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>She leant back in her chair, and a smile
so sad that involuntarily he turned away, came
creeping round her lips.</p>

<p>“Because I’m a woman,” she replied.</p>

<p>He made no reply. The meaning of her
words did not escape him, but in a moment
she translated them.</p>

<p>“You’ve painted me at the end of my

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
<i lang='fr'>beaux jours</i>,” she said. “Before they are quite
over—but at the end. I’m very grateful. But
I couldn’t live with that picture, it would be
too——”</p>

<p>She did not finish the sentence.</p>

<p>“Besides,—there’s another reason,” she
added after a further pause.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” asked François, suddenly
taking a book from the table. With a sort of
blind haste, he strove to hinder her next words
by snatching at any pretext to arrest them.</p>

<p>“It’s a book you lent me, nearly three
years ago, I’m ashamed to say. When I first
came to Paris. I’ve always forgotten to return
it. But to-day,” she paused as though her
mind were wandering away from the present.
“To-day I remembered it.”</p>

<p>François took it up.</p>

<p>“<i lang='fr'>Mademoiselle de Maupin.</i> I forgot I’d
ever lent it to you.”</p>

<p>“You remember the story?”</p>

<p>He nodded. “Of course.”</p>

<p>“It’s very different from my story, isn’t it?
But the way she found, I had already discovered
for myself before I read the book.
It’s the right way. In my case, the only way.”</p>

<p>François had just lighted a cigarette. He
threw it away with a sudden jerk, and looked
at her without speaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span></p>

<p>“I’m going to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Her voice was steady, but quite colourless.</p>

<p>“René,” stammered her friend, “René is
going to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Into the country for a few days,
for the background of his new picture.”</p>

<p>François drew up a chair, and sat down
close to her.</p>

<p>“Anne,” he began gently, “There hasn’t
been anything? Any...?”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “Nothing. But it’s
coming. This has been in my mind for weeks.
It was there though I scarcely knew it, before
you wanted me to sit to you. When you
asked me, I knew certainly.”</p>

<p>The spring twilight lingered in the studio,
and he could still see her face, white against
the cushion he had put into the chair.</p>

<p>As he listened to her quiet low voice, all
she was saying seemed to him like the illusion
of a dream.</p>

<p><em>Anne</em> to be talking of leaving René! It
was an absurd hallucination on his part—a
trick of his imagination.</p>

<p>“But René?” he asked nevertheless. “He
doesn’t know? Why, I saw him early this
morning, and he spoke of you——”</p>

<p>For the first time, her voice trembled, and

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
he watched her slim hands travelling aimlessly
over the frills on her dress.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t know,” she said. “That’s
why I’m telling you.” There was a long
silence, and he saw her fighting for composure.</p>

<p>“François,” she began at last in a whisper.
“He won’t understand at first. He’ll think
me cruel, and wicked and inexplicable.” She
caught her breath, but went on bravely. “You
are far sighted too. You know as well as I
do, the woman who will—who will——</p>

<p>“He doesn’t know it yet himself. He still
loves me. Now, to-day. And that’s why I’m
going. I couldn’t bear.... He must be quite
free. It was only on those terms I agreed
with myself to—to——” She was shivering
now from head to foot, and the words came in
gasps like the words of a dying woman. “It
has lasted for three years, and I thought it
might only be three months. I have had
quite ... quite a long life, François.”</p>

<p>He turned away so that he should not
see her smile.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to be coward enough to
spoil it—for both of us,” she went on after
minutes which seemed like hours. François
had been mechanically counting the strokes of
<del>of</del> the clock which ticked maddeningly in the
gloom. He had never noticed it before, and

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
was seized with a sudden mad desire to smash
it into fragments.</p>

<p>“But I want you,—will you, François?—in
a little while, when he will listen, to say
what you can for me?”</p>

<p>He got up, and began to walk about the
room, stumbling against the chairs in the way.</p>

<p>At last he turned abruptly, and stood before
her.</p>

<p>“Must you, Anne?” His voice was an
entreaty. It shook almost as much as her
own.</p>

<p>She got up slowly, and gave him both
hands.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, François.”</p>

<p>He held them close, without speaking.</p>

<p>“I shall write to you,” she said, “—later
on. I’m going to be a great traveller. You
will hear of me from—from all sorts of
wonderful places. And I shall see you again,
my dear friend. But I don’t think I shall
ever see——” she stopped, and he felt her
hands shaking in his.</p>

<p>“Anne!” he implored. “Don’t go.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say anything more,” she implored.
“I have to get through the evening. It’s our—last.
So you see it must be quite—It must
be quite a happy——”</p>

<p>She stretched out a trembling hand for her

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
cloak, and he wrapped it round her, fastening
it for her as though she were a child. Then
he took her downstairs, and called a closed
<i lang='fr'>fiacre</i>.</p>

<p>In the darkness of the courtyard, by the
door, he put his arm round her shoulders, and
taking both her hands in one of his, he kissed
them.</p>

<p>They were wet with the tears she had
tried to brush aside.</p>

</div>


<p><span class='smcap'>Two</span> or three mornings before the conversation
between Dr. Dakin and François Fontenelle,
Anne, the peaceful Anne of to-day, received by
the same post, three letters which interested
her.</p>

<p>She knew the handwriting on the envelopes
of each, and hastened first to learn what her
brother had to say. Hugh, as she had known
for some months, was returning to England.</p>

<p>His farm had prospered, and anxious to
launch his sons, boys of sixteen and eighteen,
in the professions they had chosen, he had
determined to retire, and end his days in the
old country.</p>

<p>The letter, an affectionate one, stated that
he was already in London where he had taken
a furnished house, to give him and his wife
time to look round, and decide upon their
future home.</p>

<p>Anne must come to see them the moment
she returned. They were all looking forward
to her visit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span></p>

<p>She put down the closely written pages
with an air of content, and turned smiling to
the envelope inscribed in the large childish
characters which recalled Sylvia Carfax.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dearest dear Miss Page</span>,</p>

<p class='double-indent'>“I <em>must</em> write to you because I’m so
happy and excited. I’ve got <em>splendid</em> plans.
Just yet, I can’t tell even <em>you</em> what they are,
because it’s a secret for the present. But it
means a simply magnificent chance for me, and
of course it has something to do with my work.
Mother and father will be very angry, I’m
afraid, but I can’t help it. It’s too good to
lose, and one can’t sacrifice the whole of one’s
future because of one’s parents. Besides later
on, they will see how wise I’ve been. Oh dear
Miss Page, <em>when</em> are you coming back? I
want to see you so much, because by that time
everything will be settled, and I can tell you
all about it. I’m too excited to write any
more. Only I want you very badly. Do, <em>do</em>
come home soon.</p>

<div class="address">
    <p>“Your ever loving</p>
    <p class='pl9 mbh'>“<span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='cb'>Anne returned the note to its envelope
with a slightly worried look.</p>

<p>What folly was the child considering?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
She must write to her at once, and insist
upon a full explanation.</p>

<p>In the meantime she opened the other
letter, which bore the Paris stamp-mark, and
was evidently from Madge Dakin. It was
very short, and very incoherent, but when
Anne raised her head and let the lilac-tinted
paper slip from her hand, her face was rather
white.</p>

<p>She was at breakfast in her sitting-room,
whose window overlooked Rome.</p>

<p>The sunshine flooded the room, and the
anemones, purple, white and scarlet, in a bowl
placed on the snowy cloth, glowed with the
colour of jewels.</p>

<p>The air was sweet with the scent of violets
which almost covered a small table near the
open window, and outside, over-arching the
city, the Roman sky was gloriously, passionately
blue.</p>

<p>Anne sat with her elbows on the table,
her chin resting on her open palms, lost in
thought.</p>

<p>Suddenly she rose, and rang the bell.</p>

<p>“Burks,” she said when the maid appeared,
“can you pack, and be ready to start for
Paris to-day?”</p>

<p>Burks stared. “But I thought we weren’t
leaving for another month, ma’am,” she gasped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span></p>

<p>“I know. But I find it’s necessary to go
at once. Can you manage it?”</p>

<p>The maid beamed with satisfaction. “It’ll
be a rush, but I’ll do it, ma’am, and be
thankful. I’m about tired of foreigners,”
she added, alluding thus with a sniff of scorn
to the Italian cook with whom she lived on
terms of ill-concealed warfare.</p>

<p>Anne smiled absently.</p>

<p>“Yes. You’ll be glad to get home, I dare
say Burks, and Paris is on the way. Please
give me my writing things. I must put off all
my engagements, and write a hundred letters,
so I don’t want to be disturbed this morning.”</p>

<p>Left alone, Anne re-read the letter which
had prompted her decision to leave Rome at
once. Short, hurried as it was, it conveyed
the misery of the writer better than pages of
outpouring, and Anne did not need the supplication
contained in the last lines to lead her
to any creature in distress.</p>

<p>“Poor little soul! Poor wretched little
thing!” she thought, before she forced herself
to attend to the lengthy correspondence which
in view of her large circle of Roman friends,
such a hurried leave-taking entailed.</p>

<p>Unwilling to hinder Burks in her work of
packing, she went herself to post her letters,
and to dispatch the telegram which warned

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
Madge Dakin of her arrival in Paris next
day.</p>

<p>While she walked to the post-office, while
she mingled with the crowds in the street, and
vaguely heard the cries of the flower vendors,
the cracking of whips, the babel of tongues, her
thoughts were far away. Her friend’s letter
had told her nothing definite, but Anne guessed
the nature of her trouble.</p>

<p>Imperceptibly, from sadness and perplexity
her expression became stern. A passionate
anger such as for years she had not experienced,
grew momentarily stronger.</p>

<p>“Always the same,” she repeated to herself.
“Cruel, cynical. Too light-minded to desire
anything strongly. Selfish enough to gratify
every passing whim——” And then her
thoughts received a sudden disconcerting
check.</p>

<p>What of the years of loyal friendship he
had given her? How could she forget his
tenderness and sympathy at the bitterest
moment of her life? How ignore either, the
many kindnesses difficult for a man wholly
cynical, impossible for one wholly selfish, which
he had shown to the down-trodden, the beaten,
the unsuccessful in life’s struggle?</p>

<p>Once again, for the thousandth time she
recognized the complexity of every human

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
being. The baffling contradictions; good
interwoven with evil, nobility with meanness,
honour with disloyalty. It was the great
intricate puzzle of human nature she was once
more considering; a tangle which nothing but
the cloak of infinite charity can cover. The
only cloak which glorifies and reveals what is
good and strong, while in pity, in despairing
tenderness it hides under its ample folds, the
shame, the weakness, the ugly scars of the
form it both shelters, and defines.</p>

<p>Anne sighed as she reached the top of
the Spanish steps, and leant on the wall to
take a last look at the city she loved.</p>

<p>Overhead, that “great inverted bowl we
call the sky,” here, deeply blue, surpassingly
beautiful. Beneath it, the dancing sunshine
playing alike on dome and pinnacle, roof and
tree, and on the thousands of men and women
in the busy streets. Men and women hiding
within their breasts incalculable heights and
depths of virtue and vice, actual or potential.
Men and women soon to be covered by the
earth on which they walked, to make place for
another, yet essentially the same swarm of
human beings between the same earth and sky,
still asking the same questions under the same
sunshine, which laughed, and never replied.</p>

<p>It was the eternal puzzle, the old riddle

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
to which through the ages no solution has
been found.</p>

<p>Anne sighed once more, and then smiled
at the futility of considering it again just now,
when there was packing to be done.</p>

<p><cite>He maketh His sun to shine upon the just
and upon the unjust.</cite></p>

<p>The words slipped into her mind before
she turned away, with a momentary sensation
of reassurance. At least the sunshine fell
upon every one alike. Perhaps it symbolized
a cloak of charity wider and larger than any
woven by human minds.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Will Madame come upstairs?”</p>

<p>The maid re-entered the room in which
Anne had been waiting, and then preceded her
up the staircase to a door which she threw open.</p>

<p>A little figure huddled over the fire, rose
hastily as she entered, and with incoherent
words that sounded like a cry, threw herself
into her arms.</p>

<p>“Oh! You are good! You are good!”
Madge repeated, hiding her eyes like a child
against the elder woman’s arm. “I should
have <em>died</em> if you hadn’t come.”</p>

<p>When at last she drew herself away, and
looked at her visitor, Anne had to suppress
a start of dismay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span></p>

<p>She scarcely recognized Madge Dakin.</p>

<p>Her cheeks were white and sunken, and
swollen with much crying. She was pitifully
thin, and her nervous hands strayed constantly
about her face. Her pretty hair, generally so
carefully waved and tended, was screwed into
an untidy knot at the back of her head. She
had evidently not troubled to dress all day,
for she wore a bedroom wrapper, whose
pink ribbons she had forgotten to tie and
arrange.</p>

<p>“My dear child,” declared Anne, “you must
give me some tea. I’m dying for it, and I
shall be speechless till I get it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m so sorry. I make it myself
generally. I—forgot it this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Anne sat down in an armchair near the
fire, and purposely allowed her to put on the
kettle, and make all the preparations alone.</p>

<p>A glance at the room, a fairly large one,
from which a bedroom opened, showed that
her friend had probably done nothing but cry
over the fire for several days.</p>

<p>It was dusty, and littered with papers, books,
working materials. It looked untidy, and uncared
for.</p>

<p>There were dead flowers in the vases, and
the curtains half drawn, obscured the already
dying light of a dull day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span></p>

<p>When the kettle began to boil, she rose,
and gently pushed Madge into a chair.</p>

<p>She made the tea herself, while in a sort of
stupor of wretchedness, Mrs. Dakin watched
the movements of her white fingers.</p>

<p>“Now drink that, my child,” she said, putting
the cup and saucer into her hand.</p>

<p>“Have you had any lunch?”</p>

<p>Madge shook her head.</p>

<p>“Then you must eat a plateful of these
excellent biscuits, and you must begin at once.”</p>

<p>She proceeded to drink her own tea, talking
about her journey, and the slowness of the
trains, till watching the face opposite to her she
saw a trace of colour in the cheeks.</p>

<p>“And now what is it, my dear?” she asked
very gently, as Mrs. Dakin pushed the cup
away from her.</p>

<p>For answer, Madge burst into a flood of
hopeless tears.</p>

<p>Anne leant forward and took her hand.
“It’s François Fontenelle, isn’t it?” she
inquired.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dakin raised her head, her lips parted
like a baby’s.</p>

<p>“How did you guess?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Because I’ve known him for a great many
years—very well.”</p>

<p>There was the faintest trace of bitterness

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
in Anne’s tone. The sight of the miserable
bowed figure had revived some of her resentment.</p>

<p>With a quick movement, Madge left her
chair, and knelt beside her, hiding her face,
with a childish gesture, while Anne’s arm went
round her as tenderly as a mother’s.</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell you everything,” she
began in a half-choked voice. “I’ve been so
wicked, Miss Page, that I—I can’t believe
it. Every now and then I think it’s a dream.”
She shivered in Anne’s grasp, and sobbed a
moment.</p>

<p>“It was my fault. I thought I was so
bored. I thought I was tired of Harry—of
Harry who <ins id='c266' title='original: was'>has</ins>
always been a thousand times
too good for me. And so I—I flirted with
<del>with</del> him. Helen Didier says I threw myself
at his head. She’s a hateful woman, and I
loathe her, but that’s true, I did. He never
cared for me. In my heart I knew he didn’t,
even when I led him on to make love to me.
It was nothing but my wretched wicked vanity.
Just because I was bored. Just because——”
Her voice sank, and for a moment Anne heard
nothing but the painful catching of her breath
in exhausted sobs.</p>

<p>“And the awful part was,” she stammered
at last, “that <em>I</em> didn’t care either. I never meant

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
it to be more than a flirtation. At least I
think I didn’t,” she added with a pitiful attempt
at perfect honesty. “But——” She stopped
short.</p>

<p>“But it became more than that. He was
your lover?”</p>

<p>She nodded her head, and then suddenly
clasped Anne with convulsive strength.</p>

<p>“And Harry’s coming to-morrow. And
I’m a vile woman!”</p>

<p>She cried the words aloud in a panic of
horror.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Page, what shall I do. What
will become of me? what shall I say to
Harry? I shall go mad!”</p>

<p>Anne laid her cheek on the head that rested
against her shoulder, and was silent.</p>

<p>She understood what was passing in the
soul of the weak, terror-struck little woman.
The horror of outraged conventions, the nightmare
conviction that she, the descendant of
generations of respectable, honest women, she
who had never heard of the sin she had
committed, except in accents of disdain or
horror, had become an abandoned creature,
unfit for decent society, branded, defiled,
eternally lost.</p>

<p>Anne’s heart went out to her in passionate
pity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span></p>

<p>“Oh help me! Tell me what to do,”
Madge wailed. “You’re the only woman in
the world I dared to tell, because——”</p>

<p>The abrupt pause, and a nervous gesture
betrayed her, and Anne started a little, overcome
by a sudden conviction.</p>

<p>“Yes. Why did you tell me, my dear?”
she asked quietly.</p>

<p>“Because,” began Madge hurriedly, “you
are so kind, so sweet, I felt——”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t the only reason.”</p>

<p>“No!” she cried with sudden recklessness.
“It wasn’t. It’s because I heard that you—that
you—Helen Didier found it out. She
never rested. And then I asked—<em>him</em>, and he
said I was never to mention your name to her.
But she found out all about it, on the pretence
that it was <em>you</em> who had corrupted my mind,
and made me what she calls fast. And so——”</p>

<p>“And so you thought you might confess to
a fellow sinner?”</p>

<p>Anne’s cheek still rested on Madge’s hair,
and over her head, her eyes smiled very
quietly into the fire.</p>

<p>Madge was silent.</p>

<p>“I knew you wouldn’t utterly despise me,”
she murmured at last, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“He has gone?” asked Anne after a
moment. “You sent him away?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span></p>

<p>“He came on Monday—two or three days
ago. I’ve forgotten when.” She made a distracted
gesture. “Until—until just lately, it
was all right. We were not—not——”</p>

<p>“Not lovers,” said Anne, finishing the
sentence for her in an even voice.</p>

<p>“Well, he came. And by that time I’d
come to my senses, and to all this awful
misery. He’s very kind,” she went on with
a sort of surprise, as a child might speak of
the unexpected clemency of some grown-up
person. “He said he didn’t want to make
me unhappy, and if I pleased it should all be
at an end, and he would go away. So he
went. But Harry’s coming to-morrow, and I
daren’t meet him. I daren’t look at him.
It’s awful—<em>awful</em>! I would kill myself,—but
I daren’t do that either.”</p>

<p>She rose from her knees, and sank back
in her chair, exhausted and shaking; her
eyes fixed on Anne were the eyes of a little
hunted animal.</p>

<p>All the terror of the gulf she had put
between herself and respectable women, all
the horror of feeling herself <i lang='fr'>déclassée</i> outside
the pale of moral virtue, filled her conventional
little soul. It outweighed the sense of her
personal disloyalty; it was greater than her
sense of wanton treachery towards her husband.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
She was no longer a respectable woman, and
in that fact lay the sting.</p>

<p>Anne leant towards her. “You haven’t
told Harry?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Then don’t.”</p>

<p>Madge stared at her incredulously. “But—but
look at me!” she stammered. “He’ll see.
He’d guess, even if I don’t tell him. I can’t
stop crying. I can’t—help it.”</p>

<p>While she spoke the tears were running
down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Yes, you can. You can pull yourself
together. He expects to find you ill, but you
can meet him with a bright face—for his sake.”</p>

<p>“For his sake?” repeated Madge.</p>

<p>“Yes. Think of him a little, my dear,
and forget yourself.”</p>

<p>“You mean he would never forgive me?
Never take me back?”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I know he would. He
loves you. You would never hear a word of
reproach from his lips. Your husband is a
fine man, Madge, and a generous one—and
a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is! He is!” she returned eagerly.
“He <em>would</em> forgive me, and I ought to tell
him. I should never have a happy moment
if I didn’t. My life would be spoilt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span></p>

<p>“And what about his?” asked Anne
quietly.</p>

<p>Madge gazed at her. “You mean he—he
wouldn’t forget it?”</p>

<p>Anne answered with a curious smile.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand much about men,
my little Madge,” she said. “When they love,
their instinct of possession is stronger than
anything you can guess. It’s bound up with
a thousand forces from primitive barbarous
times. It may be unreasonable and savage,
but it’s there. A generous man forgives, and
even tries to understand. But the wound
remains, and it rankles in spite of him. Have
you the right to inflict such a wound? The
wrong is yours. <em>You</em> should be the only one
to suffer.”</p>

<p>“But I <em>shall</em> suffer,” broke in Madge.
“And much more, if I feel I’m deceiving him.”</p>

<p>“Then accept the extra suffering, and bear
it alone,” returned Anne quickly. “One pays
for everything, Madge. Is it fair to call upon
some one else to share the expenses?”</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment.</p>

<p>“If <em>you</em> had married—afterwards, I mean,”
said Madge hesitatingly, “wouldn’t you have
told your husband?”</p>

<p>“There was no question of my marriage,”
answered Anne rather painfully. “But if your

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
circumstances were mine,” she added after a
moment, “I should act as I advise you to act.”</p>

<p>Madge’s grasp on her hand tightened, but
she did not speak.</p>

<p>“Go back and be a good wife to him,”
Anne went on. “My dear,” she said sadly,
“you don’t know your blessings. You have
married a man with a faithful steadfast nature.
His love will never fail you, and in that,
thousands of women might envy you. All
the material for happiness is within your reach.
Happiness for the lack of which many women
starve all their days. It never comes to them.
It’s never offered. And if they can’t bear to
be utterly without the joy of love, before the
earth covers them, they have to take it at a
great price.”</p>

<p>Her smile brought the tears again to
Madge’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Such a price, my dear little Madge, as
I’m glad you know nothing about.”</p>

<p>“Dear Miss Page!” she whispered. A
moment’s half-awed revelation came to her of
all that her friend’s words implied. In the
light of it, her own fears and regrets, her whole
mental attitude towards the past, later as well
as immediate, seemed incredibly petty, mean,
and trivial. She was ashamed with a nobler
less selfish shame than she had ever experienced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span></p>

<p>Her cheeks burnt, and her tears ceased to
flow.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ve been a beast!” she cried involuntarily.
“I’ve always been so selfish and hateful
to Harry. I’ve taken everything as my right.
I’ve never thought of any one but myself. I’ve
never thought of the lives of other women.
You are right. It would only be one more
selfishness to tell him. I won’t. I’ll love him
instead.”</p>

<p>“Do that, my dear, and you’ll make him the
happiest of men,” returned Anne simply. “And
don’t refuse him children, Madge,” she added
softly. “You owe him that. Besides, you’re
refusing the greatest happiness for yourself.
The blessing that women—women like me, can
never have. That’s part of the price, you see.
Not the least part of the price,” she added as
though to herself.</p>

<p>She rose, and Madge stood up too, still
holding her hand.</p>

<p>The firelight fell on Anne’s face, and the
younger woman looked at her as though she
had never seen her before,—with a tender
surprised admiration.</p>

<p>“You are so beautiful!” she exclaimed
suddenly.</p>

<p>The first smile Anne had seen came to
her lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span></p>

<p>“I shall pray that my first baby may have
eyes just like yours,” she said, almost gaily.
“And hair like your lovely hair—when she’s
a little older.”</p>

<p>Anne laughed. “It used to be brown.
It went white very quickly—in three months.”</p>

<p>As she glanced into the mirror above the
fireplace, she thought suddenly of François’s
portrait with its mass of soft fair hair, <i lang='fr'>couleur
de miel</i>; <i lang='fr'>couleur de poussière dorée</i>. She
remembered the epithets of the painters.</p>

<p>“I must go now,” she said. “To-morrow
Harry will be here to take care of you. Make
yourself look pretty, Madge. Put on your
nicest frock, and do your hair the way he likes,
high up, you know, with little fluffy curls
about. And make the room pretty, dear.
I’ll order some flowers to be sent round to-night.
Lots of them, so you’ll have plenty
to do to arrange them. No more sitting by
the fire and crying, mind! No looking back.
Only look forward.”</p>

<p>Madge held her tight. “Oh! you’ve given
me so much courage!” she exclaimed with a
long sigh of relief. “You dearest of women.
I’ll do everything you tell me.”</p>

</div>


<p><span class='smcap'>Outside</span>, in the lighted street, Anne called a
cab, and gave the address of the nearest
florist.</p>

<p>Her thoughts dwelt upon Madge, as the
carriage rattled down the boulevard.</p>

<p>“I’m scarcely sorry,” was the outcome of
her grave reflection. “It will make a woman
of her. She needed a great shock, or a great
sorrow to take her out of herself, and make
her realize what it would mean to lose her
husband.”</p>

<p>It was only while she was choosing flowers
for her, that the part of Madge’s confession
which concerned herself, came back confusedly
to her mind. It gathered greater clearness as
she drove towards her hotel, and by the time
she reached it, and was sitting by her bedroom
fire after dinner, she found herself wondering
what would be the outcome of the matter.</p>

<p>That she might be sure of Madge Dakin,
her instinct satisfied her. Yet the results
of Madame Didier’s inquiries would in all

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
probability, from other sources, reach Dymfield.
What then?</p>

<p>Anne’s thoughts flitted from Mrs. Carfax
to Mrs. Willcox, the solicitor’s wife, a lady
who was interested in Church Missions, and
Rescue Homes for Fallen Women. The
memory of Miss Goldie, a maiden lady of
substantial means, and views of life which even
Dymfield considered rigid, came to her, and
forced a smile. She saw her sitting in the
front pew in church, her black bonnet with two
purple pansies upon it, tied tightly under her
chin. She saw her angular elbows, under the
short mantle of black silk adorned with bugle
trimming. She heard her rasping voice, which
seldom softened even for Anne, who as a rule
affected insensibly the voices of her neighbours.</p>

<p>She remembered Mr. Willcox, stiff, erect,
lean-faced Mr. Willcox, loud in his denunciation
of the present age, which he considered lax
and immoral to the last degree.</p>

<p>She thought of the Vicar, with his blustering
attempts at modernity, and his violently
expressed scorn of everything but muscular
Christianity and common sense.</p>

<p>Dymfield was the typical English village,
with its types indigenous to the soil, firmly
rooted, impervious to criticism, profoundly self-satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span></p>

<p>Dymfield for Anne would be impossible.</p>

<p>But Dymfield meant Fairholme Court, to
which her heart was inextricably linked. The
garden that she had planted, the garden that
was full of fragrant memories of the blossoming
time of her life. The bare idea of leaving
it sent a pang of desolation to her heart.</p>

<p>She got up and began to walk restlessly
about the room.</p>

<p>The absurdity of such an outcome of
malicious gossip, struck her with a pathetic
desire to laugh.</p>

<p>“After all these years! At my age,” she
murmured.</p>

<p>She thought of her three years of happiness,
the little space of time which had opened like
a flower in her grey life, and wondered pitifully
why any one should grudge it to her. But
most of all, she shrank from the thought that
people should talk about it. It had been for
so many years her secret possession, the
memory that had sweetened all her later days.</p>

<p>It would be insupportable to know that
her acquaintances were gossiping about her.
About her and René.</p>

<p>A painful flush rose to her face as she sat
down again by the fire.</p>

<p>After her talk with Madge Dakin, her
old life seemed too near. She thought of the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
parting with René in the morning—the morning
he left her for his three days’ work at Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>The agony of making that parting a light
one! She remembered that he turned at the
door, and came back to kiss her again. The
sun was on his hair, as he crossed the room.</p>

<p>Involuntarily to-night, twenty years after
the words were spoken, Anne put her hands
over her ears, that she might not hear his
voice. But she knew what he had said. She
remembered how, when he was gone, her
resolution wavered.</p>

<p>Without question he loved her still.
Wasn’t it too soon? Might she not stay a
little longer? Just a little while longer?
And then the <i lang='fr'>bonne</i> had brought the letters
of the second post, and among them there
was one for René in a handwriting she
knew. Within the past month they had been
coming very often, these letters. Lately, every
day.</p>

<p>She remembered how the sunshine had
streamed upon the envelope at which she sat
staring, till at last she moved to make her
preparations.</p>

<p>Then the long train journey, and the agony
which feared to betray itself in some insane
fashion which might cause her to be stopped—forcibly

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
prevented from reaching her destination.</p>

<p>She wanted to shriek aloud, to rave and
cry, like the madwoman she half feared she
might in fact have become.</p>

<p>Of the next few weeks she recalled nothing
but a confused nightmare impression of unfamiliar
rooms, strange faces, strange voices.
Of people who for some mad reason were
going about as usual, occupied with the
ordinary business of life; talking, laughing,
eating and drinking, unmoved, unconcerned.</p>

<p>One book on every hotel table drew her
like a magnet. She would sit down anywhere
with a <cite>Bradshaw</cite> before her, and at once,
mechanically plan her journey back to Paris.</p>

<p>Over and over again, she looked out trains,
studied connections, pictured the moment of
her arrival.</p>

<p>It would be tea-time. The lamps just lit.
René sitting by the fire—René leaping to his
feet to meet her.</p>

<p>Or it would be early morning. She would
open his bedroom door softly....</p>

<p>And then the realization of her madness;
more sleepless nights, fresh strange hotels, new
cities up and down whose streets she wandered
wondering why she should be there, why she
should enter one building rather than another,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
why the day never passed, and when the
night came, thinking would God that it were
morning.</p>

<p>So terribly near seemed her past torture,
that with all her strength Anne tried to stem
the flood of reminiscence.</p>

<p>Thank God, little Madge Dakin had never
known, would never know, misery such as
hers! In the midst of her whirl of memories
Anne gratefully considered this.</p>

<p>With an effort at diversion, she tried to
recall the names of the cities in which she
stayed, through which she had passed during
the first few months of her exile.</p>

<p>In vain. She had only a confused impression
of scorching streets, of palm trees against
a hot blue sky; of seas hatefully, mockingly
calm and blue.</p>

<p>She was in Athens when the news of his
death reached her, and with it a packet of
letters written during the first few weeks
after her departure. They were letters from
René, never sent, because she had left no
address. Letters written in the frenzied hope
that some day soon he must hear from her.</p>

<p>It was then that she tasted her first
moment of peace.</p>

<p>She remembered sitting in a little walled
garden somewhere within the city, and for the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
first time seeing that the blue sky overhead
was beautiful.</p>

<p>She noticed the broad leaves of a fig-tree
clambering upon the wall opposite, and listened
to the dripping of a little stream which flowed
from a stone trough into a well whose mouth
was fringed delicately with ferns and wild
flowers. And for the first time came to her
a premonition of the calm and peace, and even
happiness of her later years.</p>

<p>Her emotional life was over. No man as
a lover would ever exist for her again. But
she had experienced the love for which she
had been willing to pay. She had paid, and
some day she would be content.</p>

<p>René dead, had become hers once more—this
time for ever.</p>

<p>Later in the year she met François at
Antibes, and heard calmly, with scarcely a stab
of pain, what she was prepared to hear. She
had been right to go. But René had died
before he ceased to love her.</p>

<p>Afterwards, her true wander years began.
And then at last, the thought of the house and
the garden at Dymfield became dear to her,
and she went to them as a child goes home.</p>

<p>Anne let her mind dwell gratefully upon
the quiet happy years she had spent at Dymfield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span></p>

<p>She thought of her work among her flowers,
and the paradise of beauty it had produced.
She thought of the poorer village people whose
lives she knew, whose children she loved, to
whom for years she had been a friend. She
remembered her little plans for their welfare,
all the pleasant trifles which made up the sum
of her daily existence.</p>

<p>And as she mused, came a wondering recognition
of the healing of time, the passing
of all violent emotion, whether of joy or of
despair.</p>

<p>From some recess of her memory there
sprang the words of an Eastern sage, who as
a motto true alike in times of sorrow and times
of delight, told his disciple to grave upon his
signet ring, one sentence—<em>This too will pass</em>.</p>

</div>


<p><span class='smcap'>Anne</span> started for London next morning, intending
to spend the night in town, and devote
the next day to her brother, and to Sylvia
Carfax, to whom she had not found time to write.</p>

<p>Early on Thursday morning she drove to
Carlisle House.</p>

<p>The page boy who took her up in the lift,
indicated a door at the end of the corridor, and
left her.</p>

<p>Anne knocked, and in response to a voice
within, entered Sylvia’s bedroom.</p>

<p>It was littered with cardboard boxes, open
trunks, dresses, hats, raiment of all sorts, and
stumbling over the obstacles in her way, Sylvia
rushed towards her with a cry of joy.</p>

<p>Even before she kissed her, Anne had time
to notice the worried look on the girl’s face,
which robbed it of its youthful prettiness.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she gasped. “I was afraid you
wouldn’t come in time, and I didn’t know <em>what</em>
to do, or how to get out of it. Oh! I’m so
thankful to see you, Miss Page. Sit down.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
Do sit down—if you can find a place,” she
added, trying to laugh.</p>

<p>Anne chose the bed as the only available
spot.</p>

<p>“My dear child, what’s the matter?” she
exclaimed. “You’re packing, I suppose. Where
are you going?”</p>

<p>“To—America,” returned Sylvia, with a
gulp.</p>

<p>Anne looked at her, and drew her down
beside her on the bed.</p>

<p>“Tell me all about it from the very beginning,”
she said, with quiet insistence.</p>

<p>“<em>Don’t</em> be angry with me,” implored Sylvia,
her lips trembling. “I thought I’d been so
clever to arrange it all myself, without saying a
word about it. But—but now I’m frightened.
And my contract’s signed, and I daren’t——”</p>

<p>“But what’s it all about? Tell me clearly,
Sylvia.<ins>”</ins></p>

<p>Sylvia made an effort to obey, and though
lucidity was not the strong part of her story,
by the end of half an hour’s questioning and
explanation, Anne gathered that the girl had
fallen into the hands of the manager of a third-rate
theatrical company. The man had tempted
her with the offer of a “star” part in a musical
comedy, and she had signed a contract with
him for America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span></p>

<p>“He said he would make my fortune,” she
declared. “He praised my voice so much, and
told me I was wonderful, and that I should
make a great hit. But he made me promise
not to tell any one I was going. He said he
wanted to have the credit of discovering me,
and all that sort of thing. I knew mother and
father would be horrified, but I thought it was
too good a chance to lose, and that I’d risk
their anger. Because, if I turned out a success,
and made a lot of money, they would be very
proud,” she added.</p>

<p>The instinctive knowledge of human nature
shared by the pillars of the Church, caused
Anne despite her anxiety, a secret smile.</p>

<p>“I thought he was so kind,” Sylvia went
on pitifully, “and he seemed so nice at first,
but lately he’s been different, and his manner
has been so funny. He—he looked at me in
a horrid way yesterday,” she confessed, “and
held my hand tight, and when I tried to get
away, he laughed. But my contract’s signed,”
she declared with a wail of despair in her
voice.</p>

<p>“Haven’t the principals of this place interfered?”
Anne inquired. “The matron, or
whoever it is who’s supposed to look after
you?”</p>

<p>“They think I’m going home,” confessed

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
Sylvia in an abashed voice. “I managed it
so that they should think so.”</p>

<p>Anne rose, and with a terrified expression,
the girl clung to her hand.</p>

<p>“Oh! Miss Page,” she gasped. “You’re
not going? I’m to sail to-morrow night,
and——”</p>

<p>“Don’t be frightened, you silly little thing.
Of course you won’t sail to-morrow, nor any
other night. Give me the address of this man.”</p>

<p>Sylvia falteringly repeated it.</p>

<p>Anne wrote it down, and stooped to kiss
her.</p>

<p>“Unpack all those things, and put them
tidy,” she said. “I haven’t time to scold you
now, but I’ll come back and do it thoroughly
this afternoon.”</p>

<p>The girl’s look of relief touched her, but
she could scarcely repress a smile as she turned
at the door, to see her standing like a penitent
baby amongst all her finery.</p>

<p>“I wonder what I should have done with
daughters?” she asked herself, half humorously,
as she stepped into a cab, outside.</p>

<p>The question was answered by a smile and
a sigh that were almost simultaneous.</p>

<p>Anne spent a busy morning. She went
first to her solicitor, and after an hour’s colloquy
with him on the case of Sylvia Carfax, she

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
drove on to her brother’s house in Kensington.
It stood in a highly respectable square, and
was one of the hundreds of dull substantial
edifices which came into existence during the
mid-Victorian era.</p>

<p>Anne rang the bell, and stood waiting
rather excitedly under the stucco canopy supported
by pillars.</p>

<p>Her present meeting with Hugh was
divided from the last, by a period of twenty
years. It was odd to remember how little she
knew of this brother, her only near relative in
the world. He would be much changed, of
course.</p>

<p>A sudden vivid recollection of the last time
she had met him, swept through her mind,
as she stood waiting admittance. How desolate
she had been. How shy. How filled
with the sense of being an outsider, a forgotten
guest, unbidden to the banquet of life!</p>

<p>The door opened, and it was Hugh himself
who drew her over the threshold, and welcomed
her in the loud, kind voice she remembered.</p>

<p>“We’ve been waiting for you all the
morning,” he declared, “and I rushed down
when I heard the bell. Come in and let me
look at you! It’s impossible to see anything
in this wretched foggy atmosphere.”</p>

<p>With his arm still round her shoulder, he

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
pushed open the door of a large room on the
right of the hall.</p>

<p>“Here she is, Alice!” he exclaimed, as his
wife rose from a sofa near the fire.</p>

<p>“Why Anne, what have you done to
yourself?”</p>

<p>The words were uttered in amazement.
Anne had slipped off her heavy cloak, and
stood laughing tremulously as she held her
brother by both hands, and noticed for the
first time that his hair was white, and his
good-natured bronzed face lined and wrinkled.
She turned from him to greet her sister-in-law.</p>

<p>The slim little creature she remembered was
a stout matron, whose hair was just touched
with grey.</p>

<p>Alice’s start of amazement as she gazed
a moment before she kissed her, was almost
comic.</p>

<p>“Why, Anne, my dear, you’ve grown quite
a beautiful woman!” declared her brother, so
simply that the tears sprang to Anne’s eyes.</p>

<p>“She’s grown younger, hasn’t she, Alice?”
He looked at her with a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>Anne laughed, and touched her hair. “But
it’s your white hair that—— And yet I don’t
know. It’s you altogether! I never saw such
a change. You—— She looks like a great
lady in a French picture, doesn’t she, Alice?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
Court of one of the French kings. Louis the
Sixteenth, that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>Anne laughed again. “My dear boy. You
make me embarrassed. Don’t stare at me so,”
she begged.</p>

<p>The pink colour sprang into her cheeks,
and the shy deprecating smile of François’
portrait crept for a moment to her lips.</p>

<p>“I’m just Anne—twenty years older than
when you last saw me.”</p>

<p>“Well—it’s magic. I give it up,” declared
Hugh.</p>

<p>“Where are the boys?” she asked, turning
with a quick, eager movement to her sister-in-law.
“I want to see my nephews.”</p>

<p>“They’re out to-day. I’m so sorry. They’ve
gone to lunch with some relations of mine. But
you’ll see them this evening. I let them go
because I knew that you would want to talk to
Hugh,” Alice answered. “You’ll excuse me a
little while, won’t you? I must speak to cook.”</p>

<p>Her voice—her tone of deference, marked
Alice’s recognition of the change in the woman
she had once regarded as insignificant, a poor
meek creature to be treated with compassion
and tolerance; and her husband’s awkward
laugh as she closed the door, was sufficient
indication that her altered attitude was not
lost upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span></p>

<p>“She can’t help fussing about the servants.
Old habits, you know,” he said, turning to his
sister. “For years she did all the housework,
and she can’t give it up.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve finished with work now,
haven’t you, dear?” Anne asked, as she sat
down beside her brother on the sofa.</p>

<p>“Thanks to you.” Hugh glanced at her
gratefully.</p>

<p>“That money was just what I wanted,
Anne. It made me. I only needed capital
to develop the farm, and it came just at the
right moment. We owe everything to your
generosity, dear. And now we’re going to talk
business. You’ve put me off in every letter,
but I must insist——”</p>

<p>Anne laid her hand quickly on his lips. “I
won’t hear a word about it!” she declared.
“You’re not going to rob me of one of the
greatest delights of my life, Hugh? The
power I once had to help my only brother?
You can’t be so unkind!”</p>

<p>Her tone of pained entreaty made him
laugh. He kissed her again.</p>

<p>“You dear absurd woman! Why haven’t
you married, Anne?” he exclaimed suddenly.
“Some man’s been robbed of a wonderful wife.
It’s not fair of you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span></p>

<p>She smiled. “Tell me about the boys,”
she urged.</p>

<p>A maid entered to announce that lunch was
served, and during the meal, the boys and their
prospects were the chief topic of conversation.</p>

<p>“Alice thinks them both geniuses, of
course,” laughed her husband. “But they’re
only ordinary youths. I shall be quite satisfied
if they can just jog along.”</p>

<p>“Rupert has great talent,” his mother
assured Anne. “Don’t listen to Hugh. I’m
sure he’ll make a splendid architect.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure he will,” she agreed sympathetically.</p>

<p>“You know we lost our little girl?” said
Alice softly, when they returned to the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>Her voice suddenly drew Anne’s heart.</p>

<p>“The boys are dears, of course,” she added.
“But I should love to have had a daughter.”</p>

<p>Anne was silent a moment. Then with a
sudden inspiration, she thought of Sylvia.</p>

<p>“Where’s your luggage?” inquired Hugh.
“Bless my soul, I’d forgotten it! You’re
going to stay with us, Anne, of course?”</p>

<p>“Your room is all ready,” Alice assured
her rather timidly.</p>

<p>“I <em>was</em> going back to-day, and coming to

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
you later. But if I may send for my things
from the hotel, I should like to stay a little
while. There’s a child I know, a girl I must
help out of a difficulty, and I find it will take a
little time.”</p>

<p>She told them Sylvia’s story, and noticed
with satisfaction that Alice seemed interested.</p>

<p>“Poor silly child!” she exclaimed. “She
ought to be taken care of. She ought to live
in some nice family.”</p>

<p>Anne made a mental note, but at the
moment said nothing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXII">XXII</h2>
</div>


<p><span class='smcap'>Two</span> or three days later, she was back at Fairholme
Court.</p>

<p>Burks had been sent on to join the other
servants, and by the time Anne reached the
house, everything was in its usual spotless
order.</p>

<p>As she sat looking into the fire the afternoon
following her return, Anne felt that it
was good to be home. She glanced round the
charming room, and experienced a thrill of
pleasure. The fresh curtains at the windows
with their rose garlands, pleased her eye. The
inlaid cabinets, the tables, the dainty bookcases,
shining and spotless from the maids’
energetic ministrations, reflected the firelight
at every angle. The pictures she loved seemed
even more beautiful for her absence, and the
pots of lilies and hyacinths about the room
filled the air with sweet scent.</p>

<p>Anne looked from them to her books, as
one glances from one loved face to another.
It was good to be home, and she felt happy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
and at rest. Painful misgivings had disappeared,
and her mind was filled with contented
thoughts of her friends.</p>

<p>From Sylvia, inexpressibly relieved, she
had just received a letter of girlish effusion
and gratitude.</p>

<p>It was in her hand as she sat smiling into
the fire, glad to remember the girl as she had
yesterday seen her, pretty once more, gay, and
full of extravagantly noble resolutions for the
future.</p>

<p>Madge Dakin, who with her husband had
returned a few days previously, she had already
seen.</p>

<p>She looked thin and pale still, but Anne
was satisfied to hear that Harry was the dearest
and best of men, and that she had never been
so much in love with any one in her life.</p>

<p>To-day Anne found the human comedy
agreeable. A spectacle to be viewed with a
smile from which tears of pity and sympathy
were not very far removed. But the smile
came first. She reflected that she must see
the Vicar, and she was making up her mind
to leave the fireside for that purpose, when the
door opened, and he was announced.</p>

<p>She rose quickly with an exclamation of
pleasure, and went to meet him.</p>

<p>He took her outstretched hand, but let it

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
drop again immediately, and glancing at him
with half-defined surprise, she saw that he
wore his pulpit expression of slightly pompous
gravity.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” begged Anne, cordially. “I
was just coming up to see you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the Vicar, dropping
heavily into the chair she indicated.</p>

<p>“I saw Sylvia only yesterday. She sent
many messages to you, and to her mother.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” repeated the Vicar. “It is
distressing to me, but I am constrained to say
I’m sorry you saw her,” he added after a
moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p>Anne looked at him in silence, and Mr.
Carfax cleared his throat.</p>

<p>“Miss Page,” he began, “I am here to
speak on a very painful subject, and I think
the sooner I mention it the better.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Anne, drawing herself
back against the cushions of her chair.</p>

<p>“I repeat, I am sorry you have seen my
child, because in future, I say it with great
reluctance, I wish her acquaintance with you
to cease.”</p>

<p>Anne still waited in silence, and again the
Vicar cleared his throat. It was difficult to
talk with her eyes upon him, and his carefully
prepared speeches seemed a trifle ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span></p>

<p>“I’d better tell you the history of this affair
from the beginning,” he broke out abruptly.
“Shortly it is this. Some two or three weeks
ago I received a private letter from a lady
whose name I will not mention——”</p>

<p>“Madame Didier,” interrupted Anne quietly.</p>

<p>The Vicar paused.</p>

<p>“Madame Didier, since you seem to know
my correspondent. It was a letter written to
me as the vicar of the parish, begging me to
warn Dr. Dakin against your influence with
his wife.”</p>

<p>Anne did not speak.</p>

<p>“Madame Didier gave reasons for this
interference,” he went on after a moment.
“Reasons which seemed to me to be based on
false and scandalous charges. The letter, however,
so intimately concerned my friend, that I
was compelled to show it to him. It was burnt
in my presence, and such was my implicit
confidence in you that I wrote a strong, I may
say a threatening letter to the lady, forbidding
her to circulate libellous reports.”</p>

<p>“I am grateful to you,” Anne said.</p>

<p>The Vicar glanced at her.</p>

<p>“I have since regretted that letter,” he
added deliberately.</p>

<p>“A fortnight ago, business called me to
London, and I spent an evening with my wife’s

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
friends, the Lovells. Madame Didier, whose
stay in England has been protracted, was with
her aunt. I did not know this when I went to
see the Lovells,” he added, “or I should
naturally have avoided the chance of an unpleasant
encounter.</p>

<p>“However, in spite of my protestations,
and my refusal to hear your name spoken by
her, the lady insisted, and to avoid entering
upon unpleasant details, I may say at once that
she gave me incontrovertible evidence as to the
truth of her assertions.”</p>

<p>There was a pause which Anne did not
break. She sat quite still, looking into the fire.</p>

<p>“I need not say,” pursued the Vicar stiffly,
“that though I was constrained to offer an
apology to Madame Didier for my somewhat
intemperate letter, I repeated my warning to
her with regard to the danger of spreading this
story.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Anne again.</p>

<p>The Vicar moved uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“Under any other circumstances—had
Madame Didier, I mean, merely reported gossip
or hearsay, I should immediately have come
to you for an explanation, and I should have
accepted your bare word against what might to
others appear grave suspicion. But unfortunately,
as I said, her evidence is incontrovertible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
I have seen letters. In short, to put it plainly,
Miss Page, to ask for an explanation from you
would be the merest farce. It therefore becomes
my painful duty——”</p>

<p>“An explanation of what?” asked Anne,
turning to him with a deliberate movement,
and again the Vicar fidgeted under her gaze.</p>

<p>“Of—of—a mode of life which proves you
to have been unworthy of the position you have
held in our midst.”</p>

<p>The Vicar gathered himself together; it was
time for the peroration, and from force of habit
his voice grew full and deep. He reminded
himself vigorously of the sanctity of the home,
the preservation of the family, and in sonorous
tones continued——</p>

<p>“You have been loved and trusted by pure
and innocent women. You have been esteemed
as a friend by myself, as well as by many another
upright and honourable man. And I say it
with pain, you have deceived us. My own child
has made you her confidante——”</p>

<p>Anne rose, and the stream of the Vicar’s
eloquence suddenly ran dry.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence, during which
he felt a prey to greater and more paralyzing
nervousness than he had experienced since the
preaching of his first sermon.</p>

<p>The pause was broken by the opening of

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
the door, and the appearance of Burks with
a letter on a tray.</p>

<p>“This is sent down from the Vicarage,
ma’am,” she said, addressing her mistress, “and
the maid says will Mr. Carfax kindly read it
at once.”</p>

<p>She handed the tray to the Vicar, who took
the letter, and with a murmured apology, broke
the envelope. A note from his wife dropped
out first. He picked it up, and hurriedly
glanced through its contents.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<cite>I am wild with anxiety. I send you the
enclosed, which has just come from Mrs. Lovell,
so that you may read it while you are with Miss
Page. She may perhaps be able to throw some
light upon the matter. At any rate, ask her
advice. She is so good and wise.</cite>”</p>
</div>

<p>The Vicar snatched up the other letter,
which mechanically, in a dazed voice, he began
to read aloud.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<cite><span class="smcap">My dear Mary</span></cite>,</p>

<p class='double-indent'>“<cite>I hasten to tell you, though I fear
too late, of something I have just heard about
your dear Sylvia. She has signed a contract
to go to America with a theatrical travelling
company, and I am told that she has already
sailed. The manager I understand to be a

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
man of bad character, as indeed he must be
to induce a girl to leave England without her
parents’ consent. This has come to my knowledge
in a roundabout way through a chorus
girl who happens to be related to my maid. I
should have telegraphed, but Simpkins has just
showed me the announcement of the company’s
departure from Liverpool, and in that case a
telegram is useless.</cite></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='cb'>Mr. Carfax dropped the letter.</p>

<p>In the waning light, Anne saw that his face
was white.</p>

<p>“You must have known of this!” he broke
out fiercely. “You must have known, I say!”</p>

<p>Anne moved swiftly to his side, and laid
her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” she whispered hurriedly.
“I <em>did</em> know. I stopped it. Sylvia is quite
safe, at Carlisle House. If I had guessed that
such news would reach you, I would have told
you at once. I was going to tell you when you
came in. But you put it out of my head,” she
added simply.</p>

<p>The Vicar’s colour had not returned. He
stood mopping his forehead slowly with his

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
handkerchief, his face working so painfully that
Anne, her eyes full of tears, turned away.</p>

<p>She opened her writing-table, and rang the
bell.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” stammered
her companion.</p>

<p>“Send a note to your wife. I can’t bear to
think of her anxiety.”</p>

<p>“True,” murmured the Vicar. “You are
very kind. It’s like you—to think of everything,”
he added, still in a dazed voice.</p>

<p>He began to pace the room with uneven
steps.</p>

<p>“If the maid has gone, run up as quickly as
you can to the Vicarage with this note,” said
Anne, sealing the envelope, as Burks entered.</p>

<p>“She’s still here, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Then give it to her, and tell her to go <em>at
once</em>, please, Burks. It’s important. Don’t
keep her a moment longer talking.”</p>

<p>The maid disappeared, and Anne lighted
the candles on the mantelpiece, quietly, one by
one.</p>

<p>“You need have no anxiety,” she said
without looking at the Vicar. “Sylvia has
been very imprudent, but she realizes it, and
is sorry. She had arranged with me to come
home and tell you all about it, as soon as I had
first spoken to you. She seemed to think that

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
I might have some—some little influence.
But I must now leave her to tell her own story.
I only want you to understand that she’s safe.
I went to my solicitor about the matter, and as
she is under age, he had no difficulty in settling
the whole affair.”</p>

<p>“But—this man?” demanded Mr. Carfax
in an unsteady voice. “The man Mrs. Lovell
mentions?”</p>

<p>For the first time she glanced at him, and
saw the fear in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Be quite easy. Sylvia had no idea of
any evil intention on the man’s part. She is
only utterly ignorant and inexperienced. She
is one of the pure and innocent <ins title='original: woman'>women</ins> you
mentioned just now.”</p>

<p>Her voice was gentle, and had not a trace
of bitterness.</p>

<p>The Vicar continued for a moment his
perambulation of the room.</p>

<p>Then he stopped abruptly and raised his
head.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said in a husky tone. “I
owe you a debt I can never repay. I——” he
hesitated painfully. “I wish to God——” he
broke out again, and again paused. She looked
at him steadily.</p>

<p>All the pompous self-importance had died
out of his face; all the arrogance of the priest

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
who denounces the sinner. His was the very
human face of a man still gasping with relief
from deadly fear, still unable to believe that the
threatened danger is over. And with this expression
of scarcely assured safety there was
mingled real sorrow, a look of real affection for
the woman to whom he owed his escape from a
crushing blow.</p>

<p>“You spoke of an explanation,” said Anne
in a low voice. “A moment ago I should have
asked you to leave me, because of the manner
in which you spoke of it.</p>

<p>“Now I have changed my mind, and I
think I should like to give you an explanation—<em>my</em>
explanation.”</p>

<p>She was still standing, still looking at him
steadily.</p>

<p>“You were kind enough to say that people
here had loved and trusted me. I am glad if
that is the case—very glad.” She waited a
moment.</p>

<p>“If as you say they have been good enough
to give me their love and confidence, it is
because I have understood them; because they
have never been afraid to tell me their inmost
thoughts. Well, you will not believe me, perhaps,—that
power of understanding would
never have been mine but for the ‘mode of
life’ to which you have alluded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span></p>

<p>“Twenty years ago, Mr. Carfax, I was a
self-doubting, colourless woman. My youth,
as I thought, was past. It had brought me
nothing. No love, no human experience, no
joys, no very deep sorrows even. Nothing but
the grey hopeless depression of a woman who
has never taken her part in the world, who has
always stood outside, who knows nothing of
life; the sort of woman who ignorant to begin
with, grows narrower and more prejudiced as
the years pass, till at last in the bitter sense
of the word, she is an old maid by nature,
useless as a friend, helpless as a comforter,
of no account in a world of men and women
she cannot understand.</p>

<p>“Well, before that happened to me, before
I was old in heart at least, I met a man who
loved me, and whom I loved. I might have
married him. I chose <em>not</em> to marry him, because——”
She smiled a little. “I need not
trouble you with my reasons. They seemed
good reasons to me, and I have never regretted
them. I lived with him for three years. The
memory of those three years has lasted with
me to this day, and has made me a woman
so proud and happy that if my deep content
has overflowed, and reached the lives of others,
it is no credit to me. I simply can’t help
caring for people, because by the mercy of

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
Heaven, I have loved and been loved. Nothing
else, for me at least, would have made that
understanding and caring possible. Not the
money that came to me, nor the opportunities
it afforded for what is called ‘doing good.’ It
was a change in <em>me</em>, that was needed, a personal
experience of loving and suffering. Well! I
have loved and I have suffered, and now I
<em>understand</em>.</p>

<p>“That’s my little story. It’s a story I
would not have told you ten minutes ago.
But—well, you made me feel just now that you
were human.</p>

<p>“Don’t imagine you see before you the
sinner that repenteth. She has never repented.
She never will repent, though it’s an old white-haired
woman who is talking—to a man years
younger than herself!”</p>

<p>Her eyes met his, and beneath their smiling
gaze, half wise, half whimsical, the Vicar
dropped his own, and reddened like a school-boy.</p>

<p>The gentle reproof, implied rather than
spoken, went home.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the presence of this dignified
gracious woman, he felt raw and awkward,
very young, more than a little ashamed.
He was confused moreover, with the sense
that there existed possibly whole realms of

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
experience which no code of morals he had
ever preached seemed adequate to cover.</p>

<p>Here was a woman who certainly possessed
the fairest of the Christian virtues. She was
gentle, tolerant, generous (with a twinge of
compunction he realized how great a part the
anticipated loss of her donations had played
in his reflections during the walk from the
Vicarage to Fairholme Court). She was
patient, longsuffering,—the Vicar ran through
the whole gamut of spiritual gifts, and acknowledged
her richly endowed.</p>

<p>Could it be that there were other paths to
the Kingdom of Heaven than the strait way
and the narrow gate that alone were said to
lead to salvation?</p>

<p>The very useful brain of Mr. Carfax, unaccustomed
to be exercised in unusual directions,
began to feel the strain, and its possessor
wisely took the hint, and abandoned the fatiguing
labour of original research.</p>

<p>In any case Miss Page was a charming
woman, and by however amazing process the
result had been achieved, a good one also.</p>

<p>He looked at her, and with a sudden frank
movement, held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Forgive me,” he said simply. “You—you
have shown me I had no right to judge.
I beg your pardon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span></p>

<p>Anne put her hand into his with a very
sweet smile.</p>

<p>“My dear friend,” she replied, “you must
do what you think right, and Dymfield will not
be behind the judgment of most of the world
in this matter. You know I love the place,
but I can’t stay here when the people no longer
look upon me as a friend. Well, the world is
wide, and fortunately for me I’m not a poor
woman.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t leave us! You won’t leave
us!” begged the Vicar. “There will be no
occasion. The position is unchanged. The
only two people who know anything of—of
the matter, are your friends. Even if through
malice or carelessness a breath of scandal
should reach others, surely you can trust us to
treat the rumour with the——” He hesitated<ins>.</ins></p>

<p>“With the contempt it doesn’t deserve?”
suggested Anne gently.</p>

<p>Greatly to his surprise, and somewhat to
his horror, the Reverend George Carfax was
betrayed into an answering smile.</p>

<p>He hastened to efface it, but the deed was
done.</p>

<p>“And Sylvia?” asked Anne tentatively.
“I wanted her to stay with me for a few days.
You have only to say if you would rather she
did not, and I won’t ask her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span></p>

<p>“If after all the trouble she has given you,
Sylvia will be welcome, I can answer for her
delight,” returned Mr. Carfax promptly.</p>

<p>Anne put out her hand with an impulsive
gesture.</p>

<p>“You are quite a dear!” she observed, and
her sudden smile still further illuminated the
dusky corners of the Vicar’s strictly limited
imagination.</p>

<p>The entrance of Burks with the tea-things
gave him a moment to recover from the shock
of a series of mental and emotional upheavals
to which he was unaccustomed.</p>

<p>“You will stay, of course?” begged Anne.
“My note to your wife was quite explicit,” she
added. “She won’t be anxious now.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mr. Carfax. “I want
to hear particulars about Sylvia, and I feel I
should be all the better for a cup of tea.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Mrs. Carfax entered a
room bright with fire and candle-light, in which
her husband sat comfortably ensconced in an
arm-chair opposite to Miss Page, who was
passing him hot cakes of a delicious crispness.</p>

<p>Anne went quickly across the room.</p>

<p>“It’s quite right. Don’t worry,” she hastened
to say, as she kissed her visitor. “I’m
just telling your husband all about it.”</p>

<p>“Sylvia must come home!” declared her

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
mother, after Anne’s recital. Her hand was
still trembling as she put down her tea-cup.
“She’s not fit to be left alone in a great wicked
city. I always <em>said</em> to George it was madness
to let her go away from us!”</p>

<p>“It’s so difficult to get women to take broad
views,” complained the Vicar, turning to Anne,
“<ins title='original: It'>it</ins> requires the masculine mind, free from
prejudice and indifferent to common opinion,
to see the wider outlook.”</p>

<p>Anne laid her hand on his wife’s arm.</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Carfax, do let her finish her
training,” she urged. “The child acknowledges
her foolishness. I quite agree that she ought
not to be alone, and before you came in, I
was suggesting a plan to your husband.</p>

<p>“Let her go to my brother and his wife.
They lost their little girl some years ago, and
Alice has always longed for a daughter. She’s
such a nice kind little woman, and she would
treat Sylvia as her own child. I spoke to her
of the possibility of this, before I left London,
and she was delighted with the idea.”</p>

<p>“It would be a splendid thing for her,
Mary, if it can be arranged. It’s so like Miss
Page to have thought of such a plan.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Carfax hesitated.</p>

<p>“We must think about it. I wouldn’t give
my consent for her to go anywhere else. But

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
if it’s a case of <em>your</em> relations, dear, it’s different.
I should feel safe and happy about her, of
course. We must talk about it, George.”</p>

<p>Anne leant back against her sofa cushions
with a satisfied expression.</p>

<p>When her visitors rose to go, she followed
them to the door.</p>

<p>While his wife was being helped into her
goloshes by Burks, outside in the hall, the
Vicar lingered a moment to hold her hand in a
tight grasp.</p>

<p>“I can never thank you enough,” he murmured.
“You are the best woman I ever
met,” he added, looking her straight in the
face.</p>

<p>Anne flushed a little; there were tears in
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” she said. “I shall look forward
to having Sylvia here next week.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When the hall door had closed, she drew
a deep breath of exhaustion and relief.</p>

<p>She had won peace with honour. She
knew it, and was thankful. But she was glad
to be alone.</p>

<p>She walked round the room, bending over
the pots of lilies of the valley, touching the
waxen bells of the hyacinths with gentle fingers.
They had been grown for her home-coming,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
and they welcomed her delicately. She stirred
the fire to a brighter blaze, and smiled to see
its glow spreading to the furthest corner of the
room.</p>

<p>Never had her home seemed so sweet, so
inviting, so restful.</p>

<p>“It would have broken my heart to leave
it!” she thought with sudden conviction.</p>

<p>She looked at the bookcases filled with
books all the more precious, because for three
months she had not touched them.</p>

<p>Finally she reached for a volume on one
of the upper shelves, and taking it to the sofa,
turned to a poem she loved.</p>

<p>Anne let the book slip into her lap. “<i lang='fr'>Nous

repeated softly.</p>

<p>It was of these “imperishable things” she
was thinking, the things of the spirit, that

persist when as with her the desire of the flesh
is dead, and the lust of the eyes. The imperishable
things that last into the evening of
life, when the stars come out, and ever nearer
and nearer draw the “murmurs and scents of
the infinite sea.”</p>

<p><span class='smcap'>It</span> was two years before François Fontenelle
re-visited Fairholme Court. Again it was
June, and Anne had taken him to the garden,
full of pride to show him her roses in the
height of their beauty.</p>

<p>They strolled round its paths talking of a
thousand things, and finally sat down under
the arch, over which there poured a cascade of
snowy bloom. The table in front of the bench
was littered with papers, which François began
idly to examine.</p>

<p>“<cite>The New Thought!</cite>” he exclaimed, holding
up one of the leaflets between his finger
and thumb. “What on earth are <em>you</em> doing
with this latter day product?”</p>

<p>Anne laughed. “A strenuous young thing
who is spending her holiday in the village
brought a heap of papers this morning, and
begged me to read them. She said it was
scandalous that such an intelligent woman as
I appeared to her, should be ignorant of the
‘movement,’” she added demurely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span></p>

<p>“Whatever the modern young woman lacks,
it isn’t cheek,” he returned.</p>

<p>“Well! What do you think of the ‘no property’
idea in the eternally boring sex question?
Let me see, there are to be state babies, aren’t
there? Have state lovers been suggested yet,
or is that a figment of my imagination?”</p>

<p>Anne sighed. “Perhaps I’m too old for
it,” she said. “I know I don’t understand it.
It all seems to me so terribly business-like, and
I was never a business woman.”</p>

<p>François laughed. “I should as soon expect
one of these roses to start company promoting.”</p>

<p>“One thing I feel quite sure about,” she
went on, drawing her lace shawl round her
shoulders. “The men and women who write
some of these letters have never loved.”</p>

<p>“Love has gone out of fashion in England,
and the new wisdom has taken its place,”
observed François. “Its professors are gentlemen
who live on grape nuts, and are occupied
municipally. They don’t believe in love, partly
because a diet of grape nuts is not conducive
to the emotion, partly because they are afraid
of disagreeing with Mr. Bernard Shaw. You
have saved me from belonging to the latter
class, but only as a brand is snatched from
the burning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span></p>

<p>“The simile is ill-chosen,” declared Anne
serenely. “There’s no fire about any of the
new doctrines. They are all eminently cool,
calculating and dull. Dull as ditch-water, and
quite as appetizing.”</p>

<p>François smiled. “You are a very old-fashioned
woman, Anne,” he declared, “and
the sight of these things near you is absurd,
and even indecent.”</p>

<p>He swept them from the table.</p>

<p>“Go and fetch your Herrick, and read
me how roses first came red, and lilies
white.”</p>

<p>“My lord shall be obeyed—another time,”
said Anne laughing.</p>

<p>“How is Mrs. Dakin?” asked François
suddenly, lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>Anne was engaged in pushing the end of a
trailing green branch through one of the spaces
in the lattice work.</p>

<p>“She and the baby, who is six weeks old
to-day, are away on a visit to her mother.
She is very well, and exceedingly happy,” she
added after a moment spent in arranging the
branch to her satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear it.”</p>

<p>She turned to him. “I believe you are,
François.”</p>

<p>“I’m also glad to hear she’s away, since

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
because of that circumstance presumably I was
honoured with an invitation to-day.”</p>

<p>“Why haven’t I seen you for so long?”
inquired Anne irrelevantly.</p>

<p>“I was afraid to come,” he said, looking
at her with a smile.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not because I dreaded a scene with
you. Have you ever made a scene in your
life, Anne? You ought to have done it once
at least, to prove your affinity with the sex
you adorn. But I don’t believe you ever have.
No. I was afraid of your eyes.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with my eyes?” she
asked, with a smile concealed in them.</p>

<p>“Anne Page, if you’re going to flirt with
me I give you due warning that I’m a poor
weak man, and I can’t answer for the consequences.”</p>

<p>She laughed. “The baby is a darling, and
I’m its godmother. They’ve called her <em>Anne</em>.”</p>

<p>“They may, but they needn’t flatter themselves
she’ll ever be as attractive as Anne
Page.”</p>

<p>“Her father already thinks her the most
lovely creature in the world—except his wife.”</p>

<p>“And how are all the other worthies? Still
at your feet, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“They are all charming to me. My little

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
friend Sylvia, the Vicar’s daughter, sang at her
first concert the other night, and had a great
success. The vicarage is standing on its head
with pride, in consequence.”</p>

<p>“And the pastoral life still amuses you?”</p>

<p>“Very much.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful woman!”</p>

<p>“Dear François, why not?” she asked.
“You know I am a very simple person.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Though you were once the queen
of quite a brilliant salon.”</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>“When are you coming over to see your
picture?”</p>

<p>“This autumn.” For a moment she paused.
“You know my wishes, François? I have left
René’s pictures to the Luxembourg. The
two we like best—you know them—are to
hang on either side of the portrait. It’s in my
will, of course.”</p>

<p>He smoked a moment without speaking.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he’ll come and look at them?”
he said at last. “I think he will, and you’ll
smile at him out of the portrait.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad he liked it,” she answered
softly, after a long pause.</p>

<p>“He only saw it once. I never dared show
it to him again. That’s why I put it away.”</p>

<p>The birds had begun their evening song,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
and the garden rang with the voices of blackbirds
and thrushes.</p>

<p>“Well! I must get back to <em>The Chase</em>,”
declared François, glancing at his watch. “I
shall be late for dinner as it is. This is good-bye
till September. Not a moment later mind,
and then you will stay in Paris a decent time?”</p>

<p>He looked at her, as she got up and stood
for a moment embowered in the roses, her lace
shawl hanging from her arms, her figure still
beautiful and gracious.</p>

<p>“The gods have granted you the gift of
eternal youth, Anne,” he declared. “I want to
paint another portrait.”</p>

<p>She laughed, and shook her head.</p>

<p>“There will be no more portraits,” she
said.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>She went with him as far as a little gate
which gave upon the meadows, through which
a field path led to <em>The Chase</em>.</p>

<p>After he had gone she wandered into the
lavender-garden, and in the gathering summer
twilight paced the path between the grey-green
borders.</p>

<p>In the west, the sky was still flushed with
sunset. The air, so quiet that not a leaf
trembled, was sweet with the scent of flowers.</p>

<p>Anne walked slowly, her mind occupied with

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
pleasant trifles. She decided that the lilies in
the south border must this autumn be divided.
She must tell Davis to plant more daffodils in
the orchard under the apple trees. There was
the village children’s treat to be considered, and
she must not forget to talk it over with the
Vicar. Suddenly she remembered that Dr.
Dakin was coming in to smoke his pipe and
talk. Madge and the baby were returning on
Thursday. He would therefore be in excellent
spirits.</p>

<p>The roses on the hedge round the sundial
breathed a sweet strong fragrance into the
dusk.</p>

<p>Anne picked one of them, and tucked it into
the front of her gown, before she turned towards
the house.</p>

<p class='no-indent bk-title mt1'>The Belovéd Vagabond</p>

<p class='rev'>“‘The Belovéd Vagabond’ is a gently-written, fascinating tale.
Make his acquaintance some dreary, rain-soaked evening and find
the vagabond nerve-thrilling in your own heart.”—<i>Chicago Record-Herald.</i></p>


<p class='no-indent bk-title mt1'>Septimus</p>

<p class='rev'>“Septimus is the joy of the year.”—<i>American Magazine.</i></p>


<p class='rev'>The Morals of Marcus Ordeyne</p>

<p class='rev'>“A literary event of the first importance.”—<i>Boston Herald.</i></p>

<p class='rev'>“One of those rare and much-to-be-desired stories which keep one
divided between an interested impatience to get on, and an irresistible
temptation to linger for full enjoyment by the way.”—<i>Life.</i></p>


<p class='no-indent bk-title mt1'>Where Love Is</p>

<p class='rev'>“A capital story told with skill.”—<i>New York Evening Sun.</i></p>

<p class='rev'>“One of those unusual novels of which the end is as good as the
beginning.”—<i>New York Globe.</i></p>
 
<p class='no-indent bk-title mt1'>The Usurper</p>

<p class='rev'>“Contains the hall-mark of genius itself. The plot is masterly in
conception, the descriptions are all vivid flashes from a brilliant
pen. It is impossible to read and not marvel at the skilled workmanship
and the constant dramatic intensity of the incident, situations
and climax.”—<i>The Boston Herald.</i></p>


<p class='no-indent bk-title mt1'>Derelicts</p>

<p class='rev'>“Mr. Locke tells his story in a very true, a very moving, and a
very noble book. If any one can read the last chapter with dry
eyes we shall be surprised. ‘Derelicts’ is an impressive, an important
book. Yvonne is a creation that any artist might be proud
of.”—<i>The Daily Chronicle.</i></p>


<p class='no-indent bk-title mt1'>Idols</p>

<p class='rev'>“One of the very few distinguished novels of this present book
season.”—<i>The Daily Mail.</i></p>

<p class='rev'>“A brilliantly written and eminently readable book.”—<i>The
London Daily Telegraph.</i></p>


<p class='no-indent bk-title mt1'>A Study in Shadows</p>

<p class='rev'>“Mr. Locke has achieved a distinct success in this novel. He has
struck many emotional chords, and struck them all with a firm,
sure hand. In the relations between Katherine and Raine he had
a delicate problem to handle, and he has handled it delicately.”—<i>The
Daily Chronicle.</i></p>


<p class='no-indent bk-title mt1'>The White Dove</p>

<p class='rev'>“It is an interesting story. The characters are strongly conceived
and vividly presented, and the dramatic moments are powerfully
realized.”—<i>The Morning Post.</i></p>


<p class='no-indent bk-title mt1'>The Demagogue and Lady Phayre</p>

<p class='rev'>“Think of Locke’s clever books. Then think of a book as different
from any of these as one can well imagine—that will be Mr.
Locke’s new book.”—<i>New York World.</i></p>


<p class='no-indent bk-title mt1'>At the Gate of Samaria</p>

<p class='rev'>“William J. Locke’s novels are nothing if not unusual. They are
marked by a quaint originality. The habitual novel reader inevitably
is grateful for a refreshing sense of escaping the commonplace
path of conclusion.”—<i>Chicago Record-Herald.</i></p>

<p class='rev'>“Anatole France is a writer whose personality is very strongly reflected in his
works.... To reproduce his evanescent grace and charm is not to be lightly
achieved, but the translators have done their work with care, distinction, and
a very happy sense of the value of words.”—<i>Daily Graphic.</i></p>
